    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach identified in the repository, focusing on established practices and preferences across various aspects of development.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a modular organization structure with clearly separated directories for different components:\n\n- `lib/` - Contains library code\n- `pkgs/` - Houses package definitions\n- `examples/` - Provides example code implementations\n- `build2cmake/src/` and `kernel-compliance-check/src/` - Source code directories\n- `docs/` - Documentation files\n\nThis modular approach suggests a clean separation of concerns and a well-structured codebase that promotes maintainability and clarity.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team has considered implementing automated quality checks as part of their version control workflow through Git hooks:\n\n- **Pre-commit hooks** (currently as samples) that would prevent:\n  - Non-ASCII filenames to ensure cross-platform compatibility\n  - Whitespace errors in committed files\n\n- **Pre-push hooks** (currently as samples) that would prevent:\n  - Pushing commits with messages starting with \"WIP\" (work in progress)\n\nThese hooks are present as samples (`.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample` and `.git/hooks/pre-push.sample`) and would need to be activated by removing the `.sample` extension.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository follows Nix formatting conventions with automated enforcement:\n\n1. **Nix Formatting:**\n   - Uses the `nix fmt` tool for automated formatting\n   - Enforces formatting standards through GitHub Actions CI checks\n\n2. **Repository Organization:**\n   - GitHub Actions workflows stored in `.github/workflows/`\n   - Consistent workflow naming conventions (descriptive, using quotes)\n   - Standard CI triggers for main branch and pull requests\n\n3. **YAML Style:**\n   - 2-space indentation\n   - Descriptive job and step names\n   - Consistent structure for workflow definitions\n   - Comments used to explain workflow triggers\n\nThe presence of automated formatting checks indicates the team values consistent code style and uses automation to maintain it.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team employs unit testing for kernel functionality, as evidenced by test files in the examples directory:\n\n- `examples/relu/tests/test_relu.py`\n- `examples/cutlass-gemm/tests/test_gemm.py`\n- `examples/activation/tests/kernels/test_activation.py`\n\nThis suggests a focus on validating the functionality of individual kernels through dedicated unit tests, which is particularly important for ensuring correctness in computational kernels.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided data, there are no explicitly defined non-functional specifications in the repository. The analysis did not identify any documented requirements for:\n\n- Performance requirements\n- Scalability expectations\n- Security standards\n- Maintainability goals\n- Memory/CPU constraints\n- Load testing parameters\n- Caching strategies\n- Logging requirements\n- Audit trail requirements\n- Network requirements\n\nThis suggests that the project may:\n- Be in early development stages where non-functional requirements haven't been formalized\n- Have these specifications documented outside the repository\n- Be a smaller project where these concerns are addressed on an as-needed basis\n- Focus primarily on functional requirements with non-functional aspects being implicit\n\nFor a more comprehensive understanding of the project's non-functional specifications, additional documentation or stakeholder input would be required.",
