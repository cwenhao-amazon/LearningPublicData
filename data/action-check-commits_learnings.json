    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a GitHub Action implemented as a Node.js application that likely validates commit messages. The project is primarily built with TypeScript, with some JavaScript components, and leverages modern development practices including testing and automated workflows.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **TypeScript** and **JavaScript**: The codebase is primarily written in TypeScript with some JavaScript components\n- TypeScript provides type safety and better developer experience\n- Key files include `tsconfig.json`, `src/main.ts`, `src/extractCommits.ts`, and various test files\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n- **Node.js**: The project is built as a Node.js application\n- Evidenced by the presence of `package.json` and `index.js`\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **Jest**: Used for unit testing the application\n- Configuration is in `jest.config.js`\n- Tests are organized in a `__tests__` directory following Jest conventions\n- Example test file: `src/__tests__/isValidCommitMessage.test.ts`\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Babel**: Used for code transpilation\n- Configuration in `babel.config.js`\n- Works alongside TypeScript compilation (configured in `tsconfig.json`)\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **npm or yarn**: Standard Node.js package management\n- Defined dependencies and scripts in `package.json`\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: This repository itself appears to be a GitHub Action\n- Defined by `action.yml` which specifies the action's inputs, outputs, and runtime behavior\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: The project is designed to be deployed as a GitHub Action\n- This allows it to be integrated into CI/CD workflows of other repositories\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Standard version control system\n- Includes `.gitignore` for excluding files from version control\n\nThe repository appears to be focused on providing a utility for validating commit messages, likely as part of a CI/CD process to enforce commit message conventions in development workflows.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach identified in the repository, focusing on established practices and standards.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team follows a structured approach to code organization:\n- Source code is placed in the `src/` directory\n- Tests are organized in `__tests__` subdirectories\n- Example files include: `src/main.ts`, `src/extractCommits.ts`, `src/isValidCommitMessage.ts`, `src/__tests__/isValidCommitMessage.test.ts`\n\nThis structure follows a common Node.js/TypeScript project pattern, providing clear separation between source code and tests.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team employs a fork and PR workflow with tag-based versioning:\n- Contributors fork the repository and make changes locally\n- Changes are submitted through pull requests (implied)\n- Semantic versioning is implemented using Git tags\n- Release process includes:\n  - Building code with `yarn build`\n  - Committing all changes (including `dist` folder)\n  - Creating annotated tags with version numbers (e.g., `v1.0.19`)\n  - Pushing with `--follow-tags` option to ensure tags reach the remote repository\n\nThis approach helps maintain a clean version history and supports systematic releases.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nCode formatting is standardized using Prettier with specific configuration:\n- Print width: 100 characters maximum line length\n- Default tab width: 2 spaces\n- Special tab width override: 4 spaces for JavaScript (*.js), TypeScript (*.ts), and React TypeScript (*.tsx) files\n\nThese guidelines ensure consistent code appearance throughout the project, improving readability and maintainability.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team implements unit testing with Jest:\n- Jest configuration is present in the repository\n- Tests focus on unit-level functionality\n- Example: `src/__tests__/isValidCommitMessage.test.ts` tests the commit message validation functionality\n\nThis indicates a commitment to code quality through automated testing, particularly at the unit level.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository appears to be a GitHub Action focused on commit message validation:\n- Enforces specific commit message formatting rules\n- Contains dedicated validation logic in `src/isValidCommitMessage.ts`\n- Includes tests for the validation functionality\n\nThis suggests the team values consistent and well-structured commit messages, to the point of creating a tool specifically for enforcing standards.",

    "summary": "# Non-Functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided repository information, there are no explicit non-functional specifications identified in the repository. The repository structure shows the presence of README.md and CONTRIBUTING.md files, which might contain information about maintainability goals, but no specific details were found.\n\nThe repository structure indicates this is likely a software project, but no explicit information was found regarding:\n\n- Performance requirements\n- Scalability expectations\n- Security standards\n- Maintainability goals (though these might be mentioned in README.md or CONTRIBUTING.md)\n- Memory/CPU constraints\n- Load testing parameters\n- Caching strategies\n- Logging requirements\n- Audit trail requirements\n- Network requirements\n\nThis suggests the project may be in early stages of development, or that non-functional requirements are documented elsewhere or not formally specified in the repository.",
