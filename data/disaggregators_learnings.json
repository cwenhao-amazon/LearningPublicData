    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a Python-based project focused on disaggregation functionality, likely for data analysis purposes. The project follows standard Python development practices with proper testing and packaging configurations.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Python**: The primary programming language used in this project\n- **Evidence**: Presence of standard Python configuration files including `setup.py`, `noxfile.py`, `pyproject.toml`, and `conftest.py`\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **pytest**: Used for testing the application\n- **Evidence**: The repository contains `conftest.py` and test files with the \"test_\" prefix in a tests directory (`tests/test_disaggregator.py`, `tests/test_disaggregation_module.py`)\n- **Reasoning**: pytest is a common and powerful testing framework for Python projects\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **setuptools**: Used for building and packaging the Python project\n- **Evidence**: The presence of `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` files\n- **Reasoning**: setuptools is the standard build system for Python packages\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **pip**: Used for managing Python dependencies\n- **Evidence**: The project includes `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml`, and `requirements.txt`\n- **Reasoning**: pip is the standard package manager for Python projects\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Used for version control\n- **Evidence**: The repository contains `.git/` directory and `.gitignore` file\n- **Reasoning**: Git is the industry standard for version control\n\nThe project appears to be focused on disaggregation functionality, possibly related to data analysis or machine learning, as evidenced by files like `src/disaggregators/disaggregator.py` and the `src/disaggregators/disaggregation_modules/` directory. However, there's no explicit indication of specific machine learning frameworks being used.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the repository. The team appears to follow structured development practices with an emphasis on modular code organization and comprehensive testing.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular structure with a clear separation of concerns:\n\n- Main source code is organized in the `src` directory\n- Functionality is logically separated into modules by category (age, gender, continent, etc.)\n- The `disaggregators` directory contains specialized modules for different disaggregation types\n- Tests are kept in a separate `tests` directory, maintaining a clean separation from implementation code\n\nThis organization demonstrates a thoughtful approach to code maintainability and scalability.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team demonstrates a strong commitment to quality assurance through:\n\n- Comprehensive testing strategy with both unit and integration tests\n- Well-organized test structure mirroring the main code organization\n- Dedicated test files for individual modules (`test_disaggregator.py`, `test_disaggregation_module.py`)\n- Separate directory for integration tests (`tests/integration/test_disaggregation.py`)\n- Module-specific test directories (`tests/disaggregation_modules/`)\n\nThis thorough testing approach suggests the team values code reliability and regression prevention.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository contains standard Git commit message hooks:\n\n- The `.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample` file is present but appears to be the default template\n- No custom commit message enforcement appears to be actively implemented\n- The sample hook checks for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines in commit messages\n\nWhile version control is clearly used, there don't appear to be customized commit message standards enforced through hooks.",

Based on the available information, I cannot provide a detailed summary of non-functional requirements. The repository appears to be lacking documentation on specific non-functional aspects such as performance, scalability, security, maintainability, memory/CPU constraints, load testing, caching, logging, audit trail, and network requirements.\n\nTo improve the project's documentation, I recommend adding explicit non-functional specifications to guide development and set clear expectations for the system's operational characteristics.",
