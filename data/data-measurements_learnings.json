    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a Python-based data measurement and analysis tool with a web interface built using Gradio. The project focuses on analyzing datasets and displaying results through an interactive UI.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Python**: The primary programming language used throughout the codebase\n- Files indicating Python usage include setup.py, noxfile.py, pyproject.toml, and various .py files\n- The entire application structure follows Python conventions\n\n## Frontend Frameworks\n\n- **Gradio**: Used for creating interactive web interfaces and widgets\n- Implemented through files like src/utils/gradio_utils.py and src/sample_scripts/launch_widget.py\n- Provides a simple way to create UI components for data visualization and interaction\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n- **Python with Gradio**: The backend is built using Python with Gradio serving as both the UI framework and server\n- The src/app.py file shows a Python application that uses Gradio to create a web interface\n- Features include:\n  - Blocks, rows, and columns for UI layout\n  - Custom DataMeasurementSuite class for performing data analysis\n  - Web interface for displaying measurement results\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **pytest**: Used for testing the application\n- Evidenced by the presence of conftest.py and test files following the test_*.py naming pattern\n- Test files are organized in a dedicated tests directory\n- Examples include tests/test_end_to_end.py, tests/test_measurement_suite.py, and tests/measurements/test_text_duplicates.py\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **setuptools**: Used as the build system for packaging the Python application\n- Configured through setup.py, setup.cfg, and pyproject.toml\n- These files define how the package is built and distributed\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **pip**: Used for managing Python package dependencies\n- Evidenced by the standard Python packaging files (setup.py, pyproject.toml, setup.cfg)\n- These files define the package's dependencies and installation requirements\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Used for version control\n- Indicated by the presence of .gitignore, .gitattributes, and .git/ directory\n- Standard Git configuration files suggest conventional Git workflows\n\nWhile the repository appears to include some data analysis or potential machine learning capabilities (with files like pmi.py and label_distribution.py), there isn't enough information to determine which specific machine learning frameworks might be in use.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the repository. The team appears to follow structured software development practices with an emphasis on modular design and comprehensive testing.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a **modular package structure with src layout**, organizing code into distinct functional areas:\n\n- `src/data_measurements/` - Core functionality\n- `src/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers\n- `src/sample_scripts/` - Example implementations\n- `tests/` - Test suite separate from source code\n\nThis structure demonstrates a preference for clear separation of concerns and modular design, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team values **comprehensive unit and end-to-end testing** as evidenced by their extensive test suite:\n\n- End-to-end tests (`tests/test_end_to_end.py`)\n- Component test suites (`tests/test_measurement_suite.py`)\n- Individual measurement tests:\n  - `tests/measurements/test_text_duplicates.py`\n  - `tests/measurements/test_pmi.py`\n  - `tests/measurements/test_cooccurences.py`\n  - `tests/measurements/test_label_distribution.py`\n  - `tests/measurements/test_text_lengths.py`\n\nThis multi-level testing approach suggests the team values both component-level validation and system-level verification, ensuring both individual parts and the whole system function correctly.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nWhile Git is used for version control (as evidenced by the `.git/hooks/` directory), the repository appears to use standard Git hooks without customization. There's insufficient information to determine specific version control workflows or branching strategies.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository contains standard Git commit message hooks (`.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample`), but these appear to be the default samples rather than actively enforced standards. The sample hook checks for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines in commit messages, but since it remains named with the `.sample` extension, it's not actively enforced.",
