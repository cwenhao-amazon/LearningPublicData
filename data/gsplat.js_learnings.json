    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a custom WebGL/3D rendering library that primarily focuses on client-side functionality. The project combines web technologies with WebAssembly for performance-critical operations.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **TypeScript/JavaScript**: The core of the project is written in TypeScript, with some JavaScript files present\n- **C++**: Used for WebAssembly modules (found in wasm/*.cpp files) likely for performance-critical operations\n- This combination suggests a focus on both developer experience (TypeScript) and runtime performance (C++/WebAssembly)\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Vite**: Used as the build tool for the project\n- Vite configuration files are present in both the root directory and example implementations\n- Vite is likely chosen for its fast development server and efficient build process for modern web applications\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **npm**: Standard Node.js package manager used throughout the project\n- Evidenced by package.json and package-lock.json files in both the root and example directories\n- Manages dependencies and project scripts\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **Jest**: Used as the testing framework\n- Integrated into the CI pipeline through npm scripts\n- Jest is a popular choice for JavaScript/TypeScript projects due to its simplicity and powerful mocking capabilities\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and deployment\n- Workflow files show automated testing and publishing processes\n- Helps maintain code quality and automates the release process\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Standard version control system used\n- Includes customized Git configurations (.gitignore, .gitattributes)\n- Manages source code history and collaboration\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for automated deployment processes\n- Workflow files indicate automated publishing, likely to npm or similar registries\n\nThe project appears to be a specialized WebGL/3D rendering library that prioritizes performance by combining TypeScript with WebAssembly. It uses modern JavaScript tooling (Vite, Jest, npm) and follows contemporary development practices with automated testing and deployment through GitHub Actions.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key preferences and working styles identified in the repository, focusing on how the team organizes their codebase and maintains code quality.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a **module-based organization with clear separation of concerns**. The codebase is structured into logical modules based on specific functionality domains:\n\n- `src/cameras/` - Camera implementations\n- `src/controls/` - User interaction controls\n- `src/core/` - Core system functionality\n- `src/events/` - Event handling\n- `src/loaders/` - Asset loading functionality\n- `src/math/` - Mathematical utilities\n- `src/renderers/` - Rendering implementations\n- `src/splats/` - Splat-specific functionality\n- `src/utils/` - General utilities\n- `src/wasm/` - WebAssembly modules\n\nThis organization demonstrates a thoughtful approach to code architecture, making the codebase more maintainable and allowing developers to quickly locate relevant components.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team enforces consistent code style through automated tooling:\n\n- **ESLint** for code quality and style enforcement\n- **Prettier** for automatic code formatting\n\nThe presence of `.prettierrc` and `eslint.config.js` files indicates that the team values code consistency and has established automated processes to maintain it. This approach reduces cognitive load during code reviews and helps maintain a uniform codebase regardless of which team member contributed the code.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository appears to use **standard Git commit messages** without any custom enforcement. While there is a sample commit-msg hook file (`.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample`), it's not actively enforcing any specific commit message format as it remains a sample file that would need to be renamed to be active.\n\nThe sample script checks for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines in commit messages, which is standard Git functionality rather than a custom team preference.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nThis project appears to be focused on high-performance graphics applications, with limited explicit non-functional specifications identified from the repository structure. The primary non-functional aspect that could be determined is related to performance requirements.\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\nThe project leverages WebGL and WebAssembly for high-performance 3D rendering capabilities. This is evidenced by the presence of dedicated directories and files for WebGL rendering (`src/renderers/webgl/`) and WebAssembly implementation (`src/wasm/`, `wasm/sort.cpp`, `wasm/data.cpp`), along with a compilation script (`compile_wasm.sh`).\n\nThe use of WebAssembly, compiled from C++, for performance-critical operations such as sorting and data processing indicates a strong focus on optimizing graphics rendering performance. This architectural choice suggests that the application likely handles complex visualizations or graphics processing that requires near-native execution speeds in a web environment.\n\nBy combining WebGL (for GPU-accelerated rendering) with WebAssembly (for CPU-intensive operations), the project appears designed to deliver high-performance graphics capabilities within browser constraints.\n\n*Note: The repository analysis did not reveal sufficient information about other non-functional specifications such as scalability expectations, security standards, maintainability goals, memory/CPU constraints, load testing parameters, caching strategies, logging requirements, audit trail requirements, or network requirements.*",
