    "summary": "# Tech Stack Overview\n\nThis repository represents a backend-focused application built primarily with Python and FastAPI. The project follows modern development practices with containerization via Docker, comprehensive testing with pytest, and CI/CD automation through GitHub Actions. The application appears to be a REST API service with a SQL database backend, likely designed for managing experiments.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython serves as the primary programming language for this project, as evidenced by numerous Python files throughout the backend directory and the presence of Python-specific configuration files like `requirements.txt` and `setup.cfg`.\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\nFastAPI is the web framework of choice for this application. This is indicated by the typical FastAPI directory structure with `api/routes` and `api/dependencies` folders. FastAPI is a modern, high-performance Python web framework designed for building APIs.\n\n## Database Systems\n\nThe application uses a SQL database, most likely PostgreSQL, based on:\n- Presence of Alembic configuration (`alembic.ini`) for database migrations\n- SQLAlchemy ORM usage as indicated by model definitions\n- Migration files in the `backend/app/db/migrations/versions/` directory\n\nThis suggests a relational database approach with proper schema version control.\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\nThe project follows REST (Representational State Transfer) design principles for its API. This is evident from:\n- Organization of code in a `routes` directory\n- Resource-specific endpoints (like `experiments.py`)\n- Standard RESTful URL structure\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\nDocker is used for containerization and deployment, with:\n- `docker-compose.yml` for multi-container orchestration\n- `backend/Dockerfile` defining the container build process\n\nThis containerized approach ensures consistent environments across development and production.\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\npytest is the testing framework implemented in this project, as shown by:\n- Standard pytest directory structure with `conftest.py`\n- Test files following the `test_*.py` naming convention\n- Specific test files for different components (`test_experiments.py`, `test_authentication.py`)\n\n## Build Systems\n\nMake is utilized as a build/task automation tool, as evidenced by the `backend/Makefile`. This provides standardized commands for common development tasks.\n\n## Package Management\n\npip is the Python package manager used in this project, with dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`.\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\nGitHub Actions handles continuous integration and deployment workflows:\n- `.github/workflows/test_api.yml` likely runs the test suite\n- `.github/workflows/code_quality.yml` probably performs linting and code quality checks\n\nThis ensures code quality and functionality are maintained with each contribution.\n\n## Authentication/Security\n\nThe application implements a custom authentication service, as indicated by:\n- `backend/app/services/authentication.py` for authentication logic\n- `backend/app/api/dependencies/crypto.py` for cryptographic operations\n- `backend/tests/test_authentication.py` for testing authentication functionality\n\nThis suggests a tailored security approach rather than relying on third-party authentication providers.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\nGit is used for version control, with standard Git configuration files (`.gitignore`) present in the repository.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach identified in the repository, highlighting key aspects of the team's development practices.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a **domain-driven structure with clear separation of concerns**. The codebase is organized into distinct domains:\n\n- API routes (`backend/app/api/`)\n- Models (`backend/app/models/`)\n- Services (`backend/app/services/`)\n- Repositories (`backend/app/db/repositories/`)\n\nThis structure follows a clean architecture pattern, ensuring that different aspects of the application are properly separated, which improves maintainability and makes the codebase easier to navigate.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team enforces **Python code style through automated linting tools**. Evidence of this includes:\n\n- Configuration in `backend/setup.cfg` (likely containing linting rules)\n- Automated style checking via GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/code_quality.yml`)\n\nThis approach ensures consistent code style across the project and catches style issues early in the development process.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team's testing approach focuses on **unit testing with emphasis on API and authentication**. Key test files include:\n\n- `backend/tests/test_experiments.py`\n- `backend/tests/test_authentication.py`\n\nThis suggests the team prioritizes testing critical components like API functionality and authentication systems, which are essential for the application's security and core functionality.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository includes a **Git commit message hook sample** (`.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample`). This script can validate commit messages by checking for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines. \n\nWhile this hook is not active by default (it would need to be renamed from \"commit-msg.sample\" to \"commit-msg\" to be enabled), its presence suggests the team may be considering standardized commit message formats.\n\nWhen enabled, this hook would:\n- Run automatically when developers make commits\n- Check commit messages for duplicate signature lines\n- Prevent commits if validation fails\n\nThe script also contains commented code that could automatically add signature lines, though this would be better suited for a prepare-commit-msg hook.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided repository analysis, there is limited explicit information about non-functional specifications. The repository appears to have some security-related components as evidenced by authentication and cryptography modules, but detailed specifications for non-functional requirements are not clearly documented.\n\n## Security Standards\n\nWhile specific security standards are not explicitly defined, the repository contains:\n\n- Authentication services (`backend/app/services/authentication.py`)\n- Cryptography dependencies (`backend/app/api/dependencies/crypto.py`)\n\nThese components suggest that security is a consideration in the application design, particularly around user authentication and data protection. However, without more detailed documentation, it's not possible to determine which specific security standards or protocols are being implemented.\n\n*Note: The repository would benefit from more explicit documentation of non-functional requirements across all categories to guide development and ensure consistent quality attributes.*",
