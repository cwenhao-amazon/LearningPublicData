    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the repository, providing insight into how the team operates and manages their codebase.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a **modular structure with clear separation of concerns**. The codebase follows Python package best practices with:\n\n- Core functionality in the main directory\n- Utilities in a dedicated `utils` directory\n- Specialized functionality (like inference-related code) in its own directory\n\nThis organization enhances maintainability and makes the codebase more navigable for developers.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team follows **GitHub Flow** with pull requests and code reviews. This is supported by:\n\n- GitHub Actions workflows for automated checks\n- Structured issue templates for standardized reporting\n- Pull request-based development workflow\n\nThis approach ensures code quality and provides a clear process for contributions.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team maintains strict coding standards through:\n\n- Pre-commit hooks for enforcing style guidelines\n- Adherence to PEP 8 conventions\n- Consistent use of type hints (indicated by `py.typed`)\n\nThese practices promote code consistency and help catch potential issues early in the development process.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nCode reviews are supported by **automated checks with GitHub Actions**, including:\n\n- Python quality checks\n- Style enforcement via style-bot\n\nThis automation helps maintain code quality while reducing manual review burden for standard issues.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team embraces **comprehensive unit testing** with:\n\n- pytest as the testing framework\n- Test fixtures for consistent test setup\n- Mocking capabilities for isolated testing\n- Dedicated testing utilities\n\nThe extensive test directory suggests a strong commitment to code quality and regression prevention.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses **structured issue templates** to standardize reporting:\n\n- Specific template for bug reports\n- Separate template for feature requests\n\nThese templates help ensure that issues contain all necessary information for efficient resolution.\n\nThe repository demonstrates a well-organized, quality-focused development approach with strong emphasis on automation, testing, and consistent coding standards.",

The workflow is configured to run on every push to the repository and scans for both verified and unknown secrets. This represents a security standard focused on preventing credential leakage through automated scanning.\n\n## Caching Strategies\n\nThe repository implements local file caching for downloaded assets, as evidenced by the cache-related files in the utils directory and the cache CLI command. This approach helps optimize performance and reduce unnecessary network requests by storing previously downloaded assets locally.\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nThe codebase implements structured logging with configurable verbosity, as evidenced by the logging.py file in the utils directory. This allows for flexible debugging and monitoring capabilities while maintaining consistent log formatting.\n\nThe project prioritizes security through automated secret scanning, implements efficient resource management through local caching, and provides robust logging capabilities with configurable verbosity levels. These non-functional aspects support the overall reliability and maintainability of the system while ensuring sensitive information remains protected.",
