    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary for Alpaca Eval\n\nAlpaca Eval is a Python-based framework designed for evaluating language models (LLMs). The project integrates with various AI service providers and supports both local and API-based model evaluation.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Python**: The entire codebase is written in Python, as evidenced by core files like `main.py`, `utils.py`, and `metrics.py`. The project is structured as a Python package with a standard `setup.py` file.\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n- **Python libraries for ML/AI evaluation**: The project is built as an evaluation framework for language models, with specialized directories for evaluator configurations and model configurations. It's designed to evaluate various AI models including GPT-4, Claude, and LLaMA variants.\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\n- **Client-based API integrations**: The project includes multiple decoder modules for different AI service providers:\n  - OpenAI\n  - Anthropic\n  - Cohere\n  - Google\n  - HuggingFace\n  \n  These modules enable the framework to interact with these services' APIs, supported by client configuration files.\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **pytest**: The testing strategy relies on pytest, as indicated by the presence of `pytest.ini` and multiple test files with the \"test_\" prefix organized in a dedicated tests directory.\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **setuptools**: The project uses setuptools for building and packaging, evidenced by `setup.py` and `MANIFEST.in` files.\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **pip**: Package dependencies are managed using pip, as shown by the presence of `requirements.txt` alongside the `setup.py` file.\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: The project employs GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, with workflow files for:\n  - Unit tests\n  - Integration tests\n  - PyPI updates\n  - Leaderboard updates\n\n## Authentication/Security\n\n- **API key-based authentication**: The project uses API keys for authenticating with various AI service providers, as indicated by client configuration files like `openai_configs_example.yaml`.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n- **Various LLM frameworks and APIs**: The project supports multiple language model frameworks and APIs, with dedicated configuration directories for different models and decoders for various providers.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: The project uses Git for version control, as evidenced by the `.git/` directory, `.gitignore` file, and `.github/` directory.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the repository, providing insights into how the team structures their work and maintains code quality.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a well-structured, modular approach to their Python codebase:\n\n- **Modular Python package structure** with clear separation of concerns\n- Directory organization follows standard Python package conventions:\n  - `src/alpaca_eval/` for main source code\n  - `tests/` for test files\n  - `scripts/` for utility scripts\n- Within the main package, functionality is logically divided into modules (decoders, evaluators, models_configs, etc.)\n\nThis organization demonstrates a commitment to maintainable, well-structured code that separates concerns and follows Python best practices.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team follows a streamlined version control approach:\n\n- **GitHub Flow** with automated CI/CD pipelines\n- Multiple GitHub Actions workflows for different purposes:\n  - `.github/workflows/unit_tests.yml`\n  - `.github/workflows/integration_tests.yml`\n  - `.github/workflows/update_pypi.yml`\n- Automated testing and deployment to PyPI\n- Automated leaderboard updates\n\nThis workflow emphasizes automation and continuous integration, ensuring code quality and simplifying the release process.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team maintains strict coding style standards enforced through automation:\n\n### Automated Formatting Tools\n- **Black** for code formatting with a line length of 120 characters\n- **isort** for import sorting with Black profile\n\n### Code Style Rules\n- Line length set to 120 characters\n- Consistent indentation (4 spaces) enforced by Black\n- Organized imports using isort with Black compatibility\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- snake_case for variables, functions, and file names\n- UPPER_CASE likely used for constants (following standard Python conventions)\n\n### Code Organization\n- Pre-commit hooks enforce consistent formatting before commits\n\nThe use of automated tools like Black and isort with pre-commit hooks demonstrates the team's commitment to consistent, readable code across the codebase.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team values comprehensive testing with clear separation of test types:\n\n- **Unit and integration testing** using pytest framework\n- Dedicated test files for different components:\n  - Unit tests: `tests/test_pairwise_evaluator.py`, `tests/test_analyze.py`, `tests/test_decoders_unit.py`\n  - Integration tests: `tests/integration_tests/test_decoders_integration.py`, `tests/integration_tests/test_example_integration.py`\n\nThis testing approach ensures both individual components work correctly in isolation (unit tests) and function properly together (integration tests), providing comprehensive test coverage.",

The repository appears to be lacking documentation related to:\n\n- Performance Requirements\n- Scalability Expectations\n- Security Standards\n- Maintainability Goals\n- Memory/CPU Constraints\n- Load Testing Parameters\n- Caching Strategies\n- Logging Requirements\n- Audit Trail Requirements\n- Network Requirements\n\nThis suggests that the repository may be in early stages of development or may need additional documentation for these non-functional aspects. Consider creating documentation that addresses these areas as the project matures.",
