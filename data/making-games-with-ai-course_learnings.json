    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a course or documentation project focused on machine learning for games, with an emphasis on using Hugging Face technologies. The project is primarily structured as educational content with automated documentation building workflows.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **YAML**: Used for GitHub Actions workflow configuration\n- **Markdown/MDX**: Used for documentation content and course materials\n- The repository primarily consists of these markup languages rather than traditional programming languages\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for automating documentation building and deployment workflows\n- The repository leverages GitHub's built-in CI/CD capabilities rather than implementing a custom backend\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\n- **REST**: The course materials discuss using Hugging Face's Inference API, which is described as a REST API service\n- The content teaches about making API calls to AI model services for game development\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **GitHub Pages**: Likely used for hosting the documentation based on the workflow configurations\n- Documentation is built and deployed automatically through GitHub Actions workflows\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **doc-builder**: Hugging Face's documentation building system is used to generate the course documentation\n- The workflows reference Hugging Face's doc-builder for transforming the source files into published documentation\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and deployment\n- Three main workflows are implemented:\n  - Building main documentation\n  - Building PR documentation\n  - Uploading PR documentation\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n- **Hugging Face**: The course focuses on Hugging Face technologies for machine learning\n- Content covers topics like sentence similarity and AI integration in game engines\n- Includes materials on implementing AI in Unity and Unreal Engine\n- Mentions Sentis for ML model inference in Unity\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Standard version control system used for the repository\n\nThe repository is primarily educational in nature, focusing on teaching machine learning concepts for game development using Hugging Face's ecosystem, with automated documentation building through GitHub Actions.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository represents an educational course with a structured, units-based organization. The team follows documentation-focused workflows with automated verification processes to maintain quality.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a **units-based course structure** for educational content:\n- Content is organized into numbered units (Unit 0, Unit 1, etc.) and bonus sections\n- Each unit contains multiple lessons in a logical sequence\n- Content is stored in MDX files within language-specific folders (e.g., \"units/en/\")\n- The structure follows a progressive learning path approach\n\nThis organization makes the educational material easy to navigate and follows a logical learning progression.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses **GitHub Flow with PR-based documentation builds**:\n- Pull requests are the primary method for introducing changes\n- Automated documentation builds are triggered for PRs\n- Preview versions of documentation changes are generated automatically\n- This allows for review of rendered documentation before merging to the main branch\n\nThis approach ensures documentation quality and provides visual verification of changes.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository implements **structured issue templates for different purposes**:\n- Separate templates exist for:\n  - Questions\n  - Course improvement suggestions\n  - Bug reports with demos\n- Templates help standardize issue reporting and categorization\n\nThese structured templates help maintain organization and ensure proper information is collected for each type of issue.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows **documentation-focused PRs with issue templates**:\n- Users are encouraged to open PRs for course improvements\n- PR workflow integrates with documentation building for verification\n- Issue templates use standard formats with appropriate labels\n- Issues are assigned to specific maintainers (e.g., simoninithomas)\n\nThis approach streamlines the contribution process while maintaining documentation quality.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nReviews are **documentation-focused with automated builds**:\n- Automated documentation builds verify PRs render correctly\n- Documentation correctness and rendering are key review criteria\n- The build_pr_documentation.yml workflow provides automated verification\n\nThis ensures that documentation changes maintain quality and consistency.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows **standard Git commit message format**:\n- No custom commit message requirements are evident\n- Standard Git hooks are used without customization\n- Default Git commit message practices are followed\n\nThe team relies on Git's standard practices rather than implementing custom commit message requirements.",

Let's summarize what we know:\n\n## Maintainability Goals\n\n### Community-driven documentation improvement\n\nThe repository appears to be primarily focused on community-driven documentation improvement, with no traditional non-functional requirements like performance, scalability, or security standards defined in the codebase.\n\nThe repository seems to be primarily focused on community-driven documentation improvement, with no traditional non-functional requirements like performance, scalability, or security standards defined in the codebase.\n\nThe repository encourages community contributions to improve the course content. The README invites users to star the repository, and the issue template specifically encourages users to submit PRs for improvements, positioning contributors as project collaborators. The focus appears to be on maintaining high-quality, accurate educational content through community involvement rather than specific code complexity metrics.\n\n*Note: Most non-functional specifications are not explicitly defined in this repository. This suggests the project may be more focused on educational content rather than production software development with strict non-functional requirements.*",
