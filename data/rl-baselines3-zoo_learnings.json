    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the team based on the repository structure and available templates.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular organization approach with clearly separated concerns:\n\n- **utils/** - Contains utility functions\n- **tests/** - Houses test files\n- **scripts/** - Stores automation scripts\n- **hyperparams/** - Manages algorithm configurations\n- **docker/** - Contains Docker-related files\n\nThis structured approach indicates a team that values separation of concerns and modular design principles.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team demonstrates a strong commitment to comprehensive testing:\n\n- Multiple test files covering different components (test_train.py, test_enjoy.py, test_wrappers.py, test_hyperparams_opt.py)\n- Coverage tracking via .coveragerc configuration\n- Dedicated test automation script (scripts/run_tests.sh)\n\nThis suggests a test-driven or test-oriented development approach where code quality and reliability are prioritized.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe team maintains standardized pull request processes:\n\n- Uses a PR template (.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)\n- Enforces consistent formatting and information in pull requests\n- Likely includes sections for description, changes made, and testing performed\n\nThis standardization helps maintain quality and consistency across contributions.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nSimilar to PRs, the team has standardized their issue reporting:\n\n- Uses an issue template (.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/issue-template.md)\n- Ensures consistent issue reporting format\n- Likely includes sections for problem description, reproduction steps, and expected behavior\n\nThis approach helps with issue triage, prioritization, and resolution.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team has established code review practices:\n\n- Pull request template indicates a formalized review process\n- Suggests reviewers evaluate submissions against consistent criteria\n- Promotes quality control through peer review",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nThis repository appears to have limited explicitly defined non-functional specifications based on the available data. The primary non-functional aspect identified relates to hardware compatibility.\n\n## Memory/CPU Constraints\n\nThe repository is designed to support execution in both CPU and GPU environments, as evidenced by dedicated Docker scripts:\n\n- `scripts/run_docker_cpu.sh` - For CPU-based execution\n- `scripts/run_docker_gpu.sh` - For GPU-accelerated execution\n\nThis dual-environment support suggests the application is designed to be flexible regarding hardware requirements, allowing users to run the system on machines with or without GPU acceleration. This approach enhances accessibility by accommodating different hardware configurations while potentially offering performance benefits when GPU resources are available.\n\n*Note: While benchmark and logging directories were identified in the repository, specific requirements for performance, logging, and other non-functional aspects could not be determined from the available information.*",
