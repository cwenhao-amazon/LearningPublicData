    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the repository, providing insights into how the team structures their codebase and maintains quality standards.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular organization approach structured by functionality and machine learning task types:\n\n- Code is organized into clear modules by functionality:\n  - `src/autotrain/cli` - Command-line interface components\n  - `src/autotrain/app` - Application-specific code\n  - `src/autotrain/backends` - Backend implementations\n  - `src/autotrain/preprocessor` - Data preprocessing functionality\n  - `src/autotrain/trainers` - ML model trainers\n\n- The trainers directory is further subdivided by ML task types\n- Each trainer module follows a consistent structure with standard files:\n  - `__main__.py`\n  - `utils.py`\n  - `dataset.py`\n  - `params.py`\n\nThis organization demonstrates a clear separation of concerns and domain-specific structuring.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows a comprehensive set of Python coding standards enforced through automated tooling:\n\n### General Guidelines\n- Follow PEP 8 with an extended 88-character line length\n- Use Black, isort, and flake8 for formatting and linting\n- Enforce quality via CI with GitHub Actions\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Use snake_case for variables, functions, methods, modules\n- Use CamelCase for classes\n- Prefix private attributes/methods with underscore\n- Use ALL_CAPS for constants\n\n### Formatting\n- 4-space indentation\n- Line length: 88 characters maximum\n- Imports: grouped by standard, third-party, local\n- Docstrings: Google-style with type hints\n\n### Code Organization\n- Modular design with clear separation of concerns\n- Small, focused functions (under 50 lines)\n- Clear class hierarchies with single responsibility\n- Type annotations for function parameters and returns\n\nThe team uses a Makefile with a \"quality\" target to run these tools, and code quality checks are enforced through CI/CD via GitHub Actions, triggered on:\n- Pushes to the main branch\n- Pull requests to the main branch\n- When releases are created\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses structured issue templates for standardized reporting:\n\n- Dedicated YAML templates for:\n  - Bug reports\n  - Feature requests\n- Configuration file for issue templates\n\nThese structured templates ensure consistency in issue reporting and help maintain organized project management.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications for AutoTrain\n\nThis document summarizes the key non-functional specifications identified in the AutoTrain repository. The project appears to be focused on efficient training and fine-tuning of large language models with particular emphasis on performance optimization and security.\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\nAutoTrain implements several performance optimization techniques for distributed training of large language models:\n\n- **DeepSpeed integration** for distributed training across multiple GPUs and nodes with optimized memory usage\n- **Checkpoint management** with custom callbacks for saving and loading model checkpoints at specific intervals (every 500 steps by default)\n- **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)** to efficiently fine-tune large language models by training only a small subset of parameters\n- **Best model tracking** through `LoadBestPeftModelCallback` to ensure the best performing model is loaded at the end of training\n- **Distributed training coordination** with synchronization points to ensure all processes are coordinated\n\nThese features collectively enable high-performance training of large models with efficient resource utilization, which appears to be a core priority for the project.\n\n## Security Standards\n\nThe project implements comprehensive security measures, particularly for authentication and session management:\n\n- **OAuth 2.0 with OpenID Connect (OIDC)** integration with Hugging Face as the identity provider\n- **Secure credential management** using environment variables rather than hardcoded credentials\n- **Secure session management** including:\n  - Sessions signed using SHA-256 cryptographic hash\n  - Version identifier for future session format changes\n  - HTTPS-only configuration to prevent transmission over insecure connections\n  - Same-site cookie settings to balance security and cross-site functionality\n- **CSRF protection** through state parameter validation in the OAuth flow\n- **Security-focused error handling** for state mismatches with appropriate remediation\n- **URL sanitization** to prevent injection attacks when handling redirects\n- **Secure redirect handling** to prevent open redirect vulnerabilities\n\nThese security measures indicate a strong focus on protecting user data and preventing common web application vulnerabilities.\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nThe project implements a custom logging solution with the following characteristics:\n\n- **Loguru-based implementation** instead of Python's standard logging module\n- **Structured log format** including:\n  - Consistently formatted log levels (8 characters width)\n  - Timestamps in YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss format\n  - Source information (module, function, line number)\n  - Color-coded log components for readability\n- **Process-aware filtering** to prevent duplicate logs in distributed training environments\n- **Standard output direction** rather than file-based logging\n- **Adaptive configuration** based on the availability of the Accelerate library\n\nThe logging implementation suggests a requirement for readable, well-structured logs that work effectively in distributed computing environments.\n\n## Scalability Expectations\n\nWhile specific scalability expectations are not explicitly documented, the repository structure suggests support for multiple backend platforms through implementations in:\n- `src/autotrain/backends/nvcf.py`\n- `src/autotrain/backends/spaces.py`\n- `src/autotrain/backends/ngc.py`\n\nThis multi-backend approach indicates a design that accommodates deployment across different platforms and environments.",
