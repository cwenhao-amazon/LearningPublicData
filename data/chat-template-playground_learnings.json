    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary\n\nThis project is primarily a frontend application built with Svelte and TypeScript. It uses Vite as its build system, Docker for containerization, and GitHub Actions for CI/CD workflows. The project is managed with npm and uses Git for version control.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **TypeScript** and **JavaScript**: The project primarily uses TypeScript as evidenced by configuration files like `tsconfig.json` and various `.ts` files throughout the codebase. JavaScript is likely used alongside TypeScript due to their compatibility.\n\n## Frontend Frameworks\n\n- **Svelte**: The project is built using the Svelte framework, as indicated by `svelte.config.js` and numerous `.svelte` files such as `src/routes/+layout.svelte`, `src/routes/+page.svelte`, and component files like `src/lib/CodeMirror/CodeMirror.svelte`.\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Docker**: Used for containerization of the application, as evidenced by the presence of `Dockerfile` and `.dockerignore` files.\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for CI/CD processes, particularly for deployment, as shown by the workflow file `.github/workflows/deploy-release.yml`.\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Vite**: The project uses Vite as its build tool, as indicated by the `vite.config.ts` file. Vite is a modern frontend build tool that provides a faster and leaner development experience.\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **npm**: The project uses npm for package management, as evidenced by `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, and `.npmrc` files.\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and deployment, with specific workflows defined in `.github/workflows/deploy-release.yml`.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: The project uses Git for version control, as indicated by the `.git/config` and `.gitignore` files.",

While limited information is available, we can identify some key aspects of the team's approach to development.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has established coding style guidelines enforced through automated tools:\n\n- **Prettier** is used for code formatting, as evidenced by the presence of `.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore` files\n- **ESLint** is used for code linting, with configuration in `eslint.config.js`\n\nThis approach suggests the team values:\n- Consistent code formatting across the codebase\n- Automated enforcement of style rules to reduce manual review burden\n- Code quality and readability through standardized practices\n\nThe use of these industry-standard tools indicates a professional approach to maintaining code quality and consistency across the project.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided repository analysis, there are currently no explicitly defined non-functional specifications identified in the repository. The analysis attempted to find information related to:\n\n- Performance Requirements\n- Scalability Expectations\n- Security Standards\n- Maintainability Goals\n- Memory/CPU Constraints\n- Load Testing Parameters\n- Caching Strategies\n- Logging Requirements\n- Audit Trail Requirements\n- Network Requirements\n\nHowever, no clear indicators for any of these non-functional requirements were found in the repository file paths.\n\nThis suggests that the project may:\n1. Be in an early stage of development where non-functional requirements haven't been formally documented\n2. Have non-functional specifications defined in documents not included in the repository\n3. Be following implicit non-functional requirements that aren't explicitly documented\n\nFor a more comprehensive understanding of the project's non-functional specifications, it would be beneficial to:\n- Review any project documentation outside the repository\n- Consult with project stakeholders\n- Examine any related issue tracking systems or project management tools",
