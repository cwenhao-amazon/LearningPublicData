    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary\n\nThis repository is primarily a Rust-based project implementing a Language Server Protocol (LSP) for Large Language Model (LLM) integration. The project follows standard Rust development practices with a modular crate structure.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Rust**: The entire project is built using Rust, as evidenced by the presence of Cargo.toml files and .rs source files throughout the repository.\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n- **Language Server Protocol (LSP) implementation**: The project implements the Language Server Protocol for LLM integration, with dedicated crates for the LSP server (`llm-ls`) and client implementation.\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Cargo**: The project uses Cargo, Rust's standard build system and package manager. This is shown by the presence of Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files at the root and in individual crates.\n- Custom build tasks appear to be implemented in the xtask crate, specifically in the dist.rs file.\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **Cargo**: Package dependencies are managed through Cargo, which is standard for Rust projects. Multiple Cargo.toml files throughout the codebase define dependencies for each crate.\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment, as evidenced by workflow files in the .github/workflows directory:\n  - test.yml for running tests\n  - release.yml for handling releases\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: The project uses Git for version control, as shown by the presence of the .git directory and .gitignore file.\n\nThe project appears to be focused on providing language server capabilities for LLM integration, with a clean, modular Rust architecture and standard development tooling.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working style based on the repository analysis. The team appears to follow a modular approach to code organization, with some standard version control practices in place.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe project is structured as a Rust workspace with multiple crates, each serving a specific purpose and having its own `Cargo.toml` file. This modular approach indicates a preference for:\n\n- **Separation of concerns**: Functionality is divided into distinct crates\n- **Modular architecture**: Components can be developed and tested independently\n- **Scalable codebase**: The workspace structure allows for easy addition of new modules\n\nThe main crates identified include:\n- `llm-ls`: Likely the core language server implementation\n- `mock_server`: Presumably for testing purposes\n- `custom-types`: Shared type definitions\n- `testbed`: Testing infrastructure\n- `lsp-client`: Language Server Protocol client implementation\n\nThis organization suggests the team values clean separation between components and a well-structured codebase.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nWhile specific testing philosophy details aren't explicitly defined, the presence of a dedicated `testbed` crate with components like `runner.rs` and `holes_generator.rs` suggests the team has invested in custom testing infrastructure. This may indicate a commitment to thorough testing, though the exact approach remains undefined from the available information.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe repository contains standard Git hook samples (pre-commit, pre-push, prepare-commit-msg), but these appear to be the default samples rather than activated hooks. Without customized and activated hooks, it's difficult to determine specific version control workflows the team follows.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository includes a standard Git commit-msg hook sample, which is not actively enforced (still has the .sample extension). This suggests the team may not have formalized commit message guidelines beyond Git defaults, or if they exist, they aren't automatically enforced through hooks.",

The analysis did not identify any concrete non-functional requirements or specifications in the codebase.\n\nThe only potential reference to caching appears to be in test data files (`crates/testbed/holes/cached.json` and `crates/testbed/holes/cached-smol.json`), but these are test data rather than actual caching strategy documentation.\n\n**Note to stakeholders:** \nConsider documenting non-functional requirements to guide development and set clear expectations for:\n- Performance characteristics\n- Scalability targets\n- Security standards\n- Reliability measures\n- Maintainability practices\n- Resource constraints\n- Testing parameters\n\nEstablishing these specifications would help ensure the system meets operational needs beyond functional requirements.",
