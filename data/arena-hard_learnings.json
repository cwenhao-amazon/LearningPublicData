    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a Python-based project focused on working with language models, particularly OpenAI's GPT models. The project has a minimal technology stack with a focus on core functionality rather than complex infrastructure.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n**Python** is the primary programming language used in this project. This is evidenced by multiple Python files including:\n- gen_answer.py\n- utils.py\n- qa_browser.py\n- show_result.py\n- gen_judgment.py\n\nPython is a popular choice for AI/ML projects due to its extensive libraries and readability.\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\n**REST API** is used for communication with external services. The project includes configuration for OpenAI API endpoints with multiple models in `config/api_config.yaml`.\n\nKey characteristics:\n- API type is specified as \"openai\" which implements a REST-based API\n- Configuration includes standard REST parameters:\n  - api_base\n  - api_key\n  - api_version\n- The API is accessed in a stateless manner with multiple endpoints\n- Multiple models are configured to be accessed through this REST API\n\n## Package Management\n\n**pip** is used for Python package management, which is the standard package manager for Python projects. This is evidenced by:\n- requirements.txt\n- requirements-optional.txt\n\nThese files list the project dependencies that can be installed using pip.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control in this project, as indicated by:\n- .git directory (index, description, HEAD, config)\n- .gitmodules file\n\nGit is the industry standard for version control, allowing for distributed development and tracking changes to the codebase.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a Python-based project with minimal explicit team preferences documented. Based on the available information, we can identify only one specific team preference.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has standard Git commit message hooks available in the repository, though they are not currently active. The presence of `.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample` indicates that the team has the capability to enforce commit message standards using Git's built-in validation mechanisms.\n\nIf activated (by removing the `.sample` extension), this hook would check commit messages for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines, ensuring cleaner commit history.\n\n---\n\n*Note: Most team preferences categories could not be determined from the available repository information. The project appears to have a basic organization with Python scripts at the root level and configuration files in a dedicated config directory, but no explicit documentation of team practices was found.*",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided data, there are no explicitly defined non-functional specifications in the repository. The analysis did not identify any documented requirements for:\n\n- Performance requirements\n- Scalability expectations\n- Security standards\n- Maintainability goals\n- Memory/CPU constraints\n- Load testing parameters\n- Caching strategies\n- Logging requirements\n- Audit trail requirements\n- Network requirements\n\nThis suggests that the project may:\n- Be in early development stages where non-functional requirements haven't been formalized\n- Have these specifications documented outside the repository\n- Be focusing primarily on functional requirements at this point\n- Need further development of non-functional specifications to ensure quality attributes are properly addressed\n\nIt would be beneficial for the project to establish clear non-functional requirements to guide development efforts and ensure the system meets expectations beyond just functionality.",
