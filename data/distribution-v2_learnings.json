The repository contains standard Git hook samples (pre-commit, pre-push, prepare-commit-msg, commit-msg) that are not yet activated (they have .sample extensions). These hooks would enforce various checks if enabled, such as preventing non-ASCII filenames, blocking WIP commits from being pushed, and checking for duplicate signature lines.\n\nAdditionally, there's a GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/main.yml) that handles copying a Docker container image from Docker Hub to GitHub Container Registry. This workflow is triggered manually (workflow_dispatch) and doesn't appear to be part of an automated CI/CD pipeline tied to specific branches or commits.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe team does not enforce any specific commit message convention. The repository contains sample Git hooks that could potentially be used to enforce commit message standards, but these are not actively enabled (they have the .sample extension). \n\nThe commit-msg.sample hook only checks for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines but doesn't enforce any specific commit message format or convention. The prepare-commit-msg.sample hook contains examples for modifying commit messages, including removing help text, but these are not enabled.\n\nThere's no evidence of conventional commits, semantic versioning requirements, or any other standardized commit message format being enforced in the repository.",
