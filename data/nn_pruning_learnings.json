    "summary": "# Non-Functional Specifications for Neural Network Pruning Project\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\nThe repository appears to be focused on optimizing neural network models through pruning, which is a technique to make models more efficient. Files like `test_speed.py`, `quantization.py`, and various speedup graphs indicate a strong focus on performance optimization and measuring speed improvements.\n\n## Memory/CPU Constraints\n\nThe repository is focused on neural network pruning and quantization, which are techniques to reduce model size and improve efficiency. Files related to masking, quantization, and fill rate analysis suggest a focus on optimizing memory usage and computational efficiency.\n\n## Key Priorities\n\nThe project appears to be a specialized machine learning optimization library aimed at improving the efficiency of neural network models. The primary non-functional focus is on making models smaller and faster through pruning and quantization techniques. This is particularly important for deploying large language models in resource-constrained environments.\n\nThe repository contains analysis tools to measure and visualize performance improvements, with dedicated test files for speed evaluation and graphs showing speedup metrics. The quantization module further indicates efforts to reduce model precision requirements while maintaining acceptable accuracy.\n\nThis suggests the project is designed for researchers and engineers working on optimizing neural networks for production deployment, with a clear emphasis on reducing computational requirements while preserving model functionality.",
