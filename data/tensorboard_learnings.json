    "summary": "# TensorBoard Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis document outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches used by the TensorBoard team, as extracted from their repository structure and configuration files.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe TensorBoard codebase follows a module-based organization with clear separation between components:\n\n- Frontend components in `tensorboard/webapp/`\n- Extensible components in `tensorboard/plugins/`\n- Backend services in `tensorboard/backend/`\n\nEach module maintains its own internal structure with further subdivision by functionality, creating a clean separation of concerns.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team employs a pull request-based workflow with structured templates to ensure consistency. This approach provides:\n\n- Standardized contribution formats\n- Clear documentation of changes\n- Structured review processes\n\nThe presence of both PR and issue templates indicates a well-defined process for code changes and issue tracking.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe TensorBoard team maintains comprehensive coding style guidelines across multiple languages:\n\n### General Formatting\n- Google style for C++ code (enforced via clang-format)\n- 2-space indentation standard across languages\n- Copyright header with Apache 2.0 license in all files\n\n### TypeScript/JavaScript Guidelines\n- Single quotes for strings\n- ES5-style trailing commas in objects and arrays\n- No spaces inside object literals/brackets\n- Parentheses always used around arrow function parameters\n- Strict TypeScript compilation with all safety checks enabled\n- Preference for explicit typing over type inference\n- Use of `unknown` instead of `any` for better type safety\n- ES2021/ES2022 features with appropriate polyfills\n- Angular's strict template checking\n\n### Rust Guidelines\n- Rust 2018 edition\n- Standard rustfmt formatting\n\nThe team emphasizes type safety, clean formatting, and consistent styling across the codebase.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nCode reviews follow a structured approach using a pull request template with specific sections:\n\n1. Motivation for features/changes\n2. Technical description of implementation\n3. Screenshots for UI changes\n4. Verification steps to confirm functionality\n5. Design alternatives considered\n\nThis comprehensive template ensures reviewers have full context about changes, understand implementation choices, can verify functionality, and appreciate the design rationale behind decisions.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team employs a comprehensive testing strategy that includes:\n\n- Unit tests (files with `_test` suffix)\n- Integration tests (e.g., `metrics_integration_test.ts`)\n- End-to-end tests (in `functionaltests/` directory and files like `manager_e2e_test.py`)\n\nThis multi-layered approach ensures code quality at different levels of abstraction.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nPull requests follow a structured template with dedicated sections for:\n\n- Description of changes\n- Context and motivation\n- Testing approach and verification\n\nThis standardized format helps reviewers quickly understand the purpose and scope of changes.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses separate issue templates for different types of reports:\n\n- Bug reports\n- Feature requests\n- Installation problems\n\nEach template is tailored to collect the specific information needed for that issue type, streamlining the triage and resolution process.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe team appears to follow conventional commit style practices, with special attention to keeping the git history clean:\n\n- Structured, descriptive commit messages\n- Use of `.git-blame-ignore-revs` to exclude formatting-only commits from blame history\n- Separation of formatting changes from substantive code changes\n\nThis approach improves repository history readability and makes it easier to track meaningful changes.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications for TensorBoard\n\nThis document summarizes the identified non-functional specifications for the TensorBoard project based on repository analysis.\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\nTensorBoard implements performance optimizations focused on efficient UI rendering and resource management:\n\n- **Lazy Loading for Card Components**: Uses the IntersectionObserver API to detect when card elements enter or exit the viewport\n- **Viewport-based Loading Strategy**: Cards are only loaded when they become visible (or within a configurable buffer zone)\n- **Preloading Mechanism**: Customizable buffer margin allows preloading cards that are near the viewport but not yet visible\n- **Visibility Tracking**: The system tracks card visibility and dispatches actions to load/unload content accordingly\n- **Memory Management**: Implements proper cleanup of observed elements to prevent memory leaks\n\nThese optimizations improve performance by:\n- Reducing initial load time by only rendering visible components\n- Decreasing memory usage by potentially unloading off-screen components\n- Providing smooth scrolling experience by preloading nearby content\n- Optimizing resource usage in dashboards with many cards/visualizations\n\n## Security Standards\n\nTensorBoard implements several security standards and best practices:\n\n### Content Security Policy (CSP) Enforcement\n- SecurityValidatorMiddleware validates that HTML responses include proper CSP headers\n- Follows principle of least privilege for resource loading\n- Requires default-src directive\n- Only allows specific trusted sources: 'self', 'none', https: URLs, and sha256 hashes\n- Has specific exceptions for necessary use cases (unsafe-inline for styles, data: URIs, etc.)\n\n### Response Header Security Requirements\n- Enforces Content-Type headers on all responses\n- Requires X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff to prevent MIME type sniffing attacks\n\n### Security Reporting and Vulnerability Disclosure\n- References TensorFlow's security model and guidelines\n- Provides a security email (security@tensorflow.org) for reporting vulnerabilities\n- Mentions encryption key availability for sensitive disclosures\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nTensorBoard implements a simple logging approach:\n\n- Uses Python's standard logging module\n- Creates a dedicated logger named \"tensorboard\"\n- Provides a getter function to access this logger\n- Enables consistent logging across the application\n- Allows for centralized configuration of the logger\n\nThe implementation is minimal and likely relies on default behavior of Python's logging module or configures it elsewhere in the codebase.",
