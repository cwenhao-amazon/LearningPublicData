    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary for Ionic Framework Repository\n\nThis repository demonstrates a well-structured, cross-framework component library with clear organization patterns and development workflows. The team maintains a sophisticated approach to code management across multiple JavaScript frameworks while sharing core functionality.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe Ionic Framework repository is organized using a framework-specific directory structure with shared core components:\n\n- `core/` - Contains framework-agnostic components\n- `angular/` - Angular-specific implementation\n- `react/` - React-specific implementation\n- `vue/` - Vue-specific implementation\n\nEach framework directory follows its own internal organization pattern while leveraging the shared core functionality.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team employs a feature branch workflow with pull requests for code integration:\n\n- Developers work on feature branches\n- Pull requests are used for code reviews\n- Standardized templates guide the PR process\n- Contributing guidelines document the expected workflow\n\nThis approach ensures code quality through peer review before integration into the main codebase.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team maintains comprehensive coding style guidelines across all framework implementations:\n\n### General Formatting\n- UTF-8 character encoding\n- 2 spaces for indentation (no tabs)\n- LF (Unix) line endings\n- Final newline at end of files\n- Trimmed trailing whitespace (except in Markdown)\n\n### TypeScript Guidelines\n- TypeScript for type safety\n- Following tslint-ionic-rules with project-specific exceptions\n- Functional programming patterns preferred\n- Explicit typing for function parameters and returns\n- Interfaces for complex object types\n- Minimal type assertions\n- `const` for immutable variables\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- camelCase for variables, parameters, and functions\n- PascalCase for interfaces, classes, and types\n- Descriptive, intention-revealing names\n- Boolean variables prefixed with \"is\", \"has\", etc.\n- Consistent naming patterns within component families\n\n### Code Organization\n- Small, focused functions\n- Feature/component-based organization\n- Explicit exports for external use\n- Related functions grouped together\n- Barrel exports (index.ts) for public APIs\n\n### CSS/SCSS Guidelines\n- SMACSS methodology for property ordering\n- Logical property grouping with empty lines\n- Double quotes for CSS strings\n- Platform-specific styles when needed\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team implements pull request based code reviews with standardized templates:\n\n- Structured PR template with specific sections\n- Likely includes description, changes, and testing information\n- Contributing guidelines that set expectations for code reviews\n\nThis standardized approach ensures consistent review quality and documentation.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe repository demonstrates a commitment to thorough testing:\n\n- Component-level E2E testing\n- Extensive test coverage\n- Each component has its own test directory\n- Various test scenarios for components\n- Dedicated test applications for framework-specific implementations\n\nThis suggests the team values comprehensive testing to ensure component reliability across frameworks.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nPull requests follow a structured template with specific sections, likely including:\n\n- Description of changes\n- Testing information\n- Related issues\n- Breaking changes\n- Screenshots or demos when applicable\n\nThis standardized approach ensures PRs contain all necessary information for effective reviews.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses multiple issue templates for different types of issues:\n\n- Bug reports\n- Feature requests\n- Support questions\n- Documentation issues\n- CLI-related issues\n\nThis structured approach helps categorize issues appropriately and ensures reporters provide all necessary information.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows conventional commit format with careful documentation of breaking changes:\n\n- Structured commit messages that can be parsed for changelogs\n- Breaking changes are carefully documented in dedicated files (BREAKING.md)\n- Framework-specific breaking changes are documented separately\n- Changelog is likely generated automatically from commit messages\n\nThis approach ensures clear communication of changes and facilitates automated release processes.",
