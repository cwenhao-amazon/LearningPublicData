    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a machine learning project focused on shot classification, built primarily with Python and utilizing high-performance computing resources. Below is a summary of the key technologies identified in the codebase.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n**Python** is the primary programming language used in this project, as evidenced by multiple Python files:\n- Core processing scripts: `accuracy.py`, `data.py`, `inference.py`, `train.py`\n- Jupyter notebook: `shot_classification.ipynb`\n- Python dependency management: `requirements.txt`\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n**Likely PyTorch or similar ML framework** is being used for the machine learning implementation. This is indicated by:\n- Standard ML workflow files (`train.py`, `inference.py`, `accuracy.py`)\n- A classification notebook (`shot_classification.ipynb`)\n- Configuration structure:\n  - `configs/training-configs/config.yaml` for model training parameters\n  - `configs/accelerate-configs/ds.yaml` which may refer to DeepSpeed acceleration\n\nThe project appears to be implementing a shot classification model, likely for sports analytics or video processing.\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n**SLURM Workload Manager** is used for job scheduling and resource management, as evidenced by:\n- `run.slurm` file for batch job submission\n\nThis indicates the project is designed to run on high-performance computing clusters or similar environments that utilize SLURM for workload management.\n\n## Package Management\n\n**pip** is used for Python package dependency management:\n- `requirements.txt` file lists the project's Python dependencies\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control:\n- `.git/config` directory\n- `.gitignore` file for specifying intentionally untracked files\n\nThe project follows standard practices for Python-based machine learning development with appropriate configuration for high-performance computing environments.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working approaches based on the repository analysis. While limited information is available, we can identify some key aspects of the team's approach to development and testing.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team employs a **quantitative evaluation with metrics-based testing** approach to validate their machine learning models. This is evident from their implementation in the `accuracy.py` file.\n\nKey aspects of their testing philosophy include:\n\n- **Comprehensive evaluation framework** that measures model performance using multiple metrics:\n  - Precision\n  - Recall\n  - F1-score\n  - Accuracy\n\n- **Category-based evaluation** across multiple dimensions:\n  - Color\n  - Lighting\n  - Lighting type\n  - Composition\n\n- **Integration with tracking tools** - Results are logged to Weights & Biases (wandb) for monitoring and analysis\n\n- **Empirical evaluation focus** - The team prioritizes quantitative measurement of model performance against reference datasets rather than using test-driven or behavior-driven development methodologies\n\nThis testing approach suggests the team values data-driven decision making and relies on objective metrics to evaluate the quality and performance of their machine learning models.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\nThe project utilizes DeepSpeed ZeRO-2 optimization for distributed training, with specific configuration choices that prioritize memory efficiency over raw speed. Key aspects include:\n\n- DeepSpeed ZeRO Stage 2 optimization for memory usage reduction through optimizer state partitioning\n- CPU offloading for both parameters and optimizer states\n- Configuration for 8 processes on a single machine for parallel processing\n- Gradient clipping set to 1.0 to prevent exploding gradients\n\nThis configuration suggests the system is designed for training large models with memory optimization as a priority, trading some speed for reduced GPU memory requirements.",
