    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the repository.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team follows a **feature-based organization** structure with clear separation of concerns:\n\n- `src/routes`: Page routes and endpoints\n- `src/lib/components`: UI elements\n- `src/lib/utils`: Helper functions\n- `src/lib/server`: Server-side code\n\nThis organization pattern helps maintain code clarity and makes it easier to locate specific functionality within the project.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team employs **GitHub Flow** with integrated CI/CD pipelines:\n\n- Pull requests are used for code changes\n- Automated workflows for linting and testing\n- Documentation is automatically built for PRs\n\nThis approach ensures code quality through automated checks before merging changes into the main branch.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nCode quality and consistency are maintained through automated tools:\n\n- **ESLint** for code quality enforcement\n- **Prettier** for consistent code formatting\n- Configuration files (.eslintrc.cjs, .prettierrc) define project-specific rules\n- Ignore files (.eslintignore, .prettierignore) exclude certain files/directories from processing\n\nThese tools help maintain a consistent codebase and reduce time spent on formatting discussions during code reviews.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team implements **unit testing** throughout the codebase:\n\n- **Vitest** is used as the testing framework\n- Test files follow the `.spec.ts` naming convention\n- Tests are written for utilities, migrations, and route handlers\n\nThis indicates a commitment to code quality and regression prevention through automated testing.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository contains **structured issue templates** for different types of reports:\n\n- Bug report templates for Chat UI\n- Feature request templates for Chat UI\n- HuggingChat-specific issue templates\n\nThese templates help standardize issue reporting, ensuring that contributors provide all necessary information when submitting bugs or feature requests.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe team enforces code quality at commit time:\n\n- **Husky** pre-commit hooks are implemented\n- **lint-staged** runs against changed files before allowing commits\n- Custom configuration in `.husky/lint-stage-config.js`\n\nWhile this doesn't specify the exact format for commit messages, it demonstrates the team's commitment to maintaining code quality standards at every step of the development process.",

The primary focus seems to be on cloud-native deployment patterns with attention to scalability, reliability, and network security.\n\n## Scalability Expectations\n\nThe application implements Kubernetes-based horizontal scaling through the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) configuration found in `chart/templates/hpa.yaml`. This indicates the system is designed to automatically scale the number of pod replicas based on observed metrics like CPU utilization or custom metrics, allowing the application to handle varying loads efficiently.\n\n## Reliability Targets\n\nReliability is addressed through Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes, likely configured in the `chart/templates/deployment.yaml` file. These probes are essential Kubernetes mechanisms that:\n\n- Liveness probes determine if a container is running properly and should be restarted if failing\n- Readiness probes determine if a container is ready to accept traffic\n- Together they ensure the application maintains high availability and properly handles service initialization\n\n## Network Requirements\n\nThe project implements Kubernetes network policies as evidenced by `chart/templates/network-policy.yaml`. These policies define rules for pod-to-pod communication within the Kubernetes cluster, controlling:\n\n- Which pods can communicate with each other\n- What ports and protocols are allowed\n- Ingress and egress traffic patterns\n\nThis suggests a security-conscious approach to network traffic management within the application's infrastructure.\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nA custom logger implementation is present in `src/lib/server/logger.ts`. While specific logging requirements aren't explicitly documented, the presence of a dedicated logging module indicates structured logging is a priority for the application, likely for troubleshooting and monitoring purposes.",
