    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be focused on deep learning work, with a minimal technology stack identified. The project is primarily built around Python-based machine learning tools, using standard development practices.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Python**: Used as the primary programming language for the project\n- Found in Jupyter notebook files (specifically `session1/deep-learning.ipynb`)\n- Python is the standard choice for data science and machine learning tasks due to its extensive ecosystem of libraries and tools\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n- **Deep Learning**: The repository contains materials focused on deep learning techniques\n- Evidenced by the presence of `session1/deep-learning.ipynb` notebook\n- While the specific framework (TensorFlow, PyTorch, etc.) cannot be determined from just the filename, the repository is clearly focused on deep learning applications\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Used for version control in this project\n- Standard Git configuration files and directories are present (`.git/config`, `.git/HEAD`, `.git/index`)\n- Git provides distributed version control capabilities essential for collaborative development and code history tracking",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach identified in the repository, which appears to be an educational project focused on deep learning concepts.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a session-based organization structure, suggesting a course or workshop format where content is divided into sequential learning modules. This is evidenced by the directory structure (e.g., \"session1\") containing Jupyter notebooks related to deep learning.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows a comprehensive set of Python coding style guidelines:\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Descriptive variable names are used (e.g., `x1w1`, `x1w1x2w2`)\n- Class names follow CapWords/PascalCase convention (e.g., `Value`)\n- Function and method names use snake_case (e.g., `build_topo`, `_backward`)\n- Private methods/attributes are prefixed with underscore (e.g., `_backward`, `_prev`)\n\n### Code Organization\n- Imports are grouped by standard library, third-party, and local modules\n- Jupyter notebooks are organized with markdown headings and code cells\n- Classes include docstrings explaining their purpose\n- Functions have clear, single responsibilities\n\n### Formatting\n- 2-space indentation is used consistently\n- Line length is kept reasonable though appears flexible\n- Whitespace is used around operators for improved readability\n- Semicolons are not used to terminate statements\n\n### Comments\n- Comments explain \"why\" rather than \"what\"\n- Markdown cells in notebooks provide context and explanations\n- Code sections are clearly labeled with markdown headers\n- Attribution is given for borrowed code\n\nThe coding style appears to prioritize clarity and readability, which aligns with the educational nature of the repository. The well-structured code with descriptive naming and appropriate comments suggests a focus on making the content accessible and understandable to learners.",

The analysis did not identify any documented non-functional requirements across the categories examined.\n\nThis suggests that the project may:\n\n- Not have formalized non-functional requirements documentation\n- Possibly rely on implicit understanding of non-functional aspects\n- Potentially need to develop explicit non-functional specifications as the project matures\n\n**Recommendation:** Consider establishing formal non-functional requirements to guide development and ensure quality attributes are properly addressed as the project evolves.",
