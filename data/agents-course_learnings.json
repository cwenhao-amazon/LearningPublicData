    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be an educational project focused on LLMs and agents, primarily consisting of documentation in MDX format. The technical infrastructure is relatively lightweight, focusing on content delivery rather than application development.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Python**: Used for scripting and tooling in the project\n  - Found in `scripts/` directory (translation.py, vi.py)\n  - Also used in `quiz/` directory (push_questions.py)\n  - Primarily serves as a support language for content management\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **uv**: Modern Python package management tool\n  - Evidenced by the presence of `quiz/uv.lock`\n  - Uses `pyproject.toml` for dependency specification, indicating modern Python packaging practices\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **GitHub Pages**: Likely used for documentation hosting\n  - Inferred from GitHub workflow files focused on building and uploading documentation\n  - Provides a straightforward way to publish the educational content\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and deployment\n  - Multiple workflow files present:\n    - `build_documentation.yml`\n    - `build_pr_documentation.yml`\n    - `upload_pr_documentation.yml`\n  - Primarily focused on automating documentation building and deployment\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Standard version control system\n  - Evidenced by `.git/` directory and `.gitignore` file\n  - Used to track changes to the educational content and scripts",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be an educational content repository with multi-language support. The team has established specific organizational patterns and contribution guidelines to maintain consistency across the educational materials.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a structured organization pattern focused on educational content:\n\n- Content is organized primarily by language (en, es, fr, ko, ru-RU, vi, zh-CN)\n- Within each language directory, content is further organized into numbered units (unit0, unit1, etc.)\n- Special \"bonus units\" exist alongside the standard numbered units\n- This structure suggests a well-defined educational course progression\n\nThis organization makes it easy to navigate between equivalent content in different languages while maintaining a consistent learning path.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has established structured PR guidelines for educational content contributions:\n\n- **Pre-approval requirement**: New sections or units require description and validation before writing\n- **Direct PRs allowed**: Minor fixes like typos can be submitted directly without prior discussion\n- **Structured formats**: Specific title formats and automatic labeling are used\n\nThis approach allows the team to maintain quality control over substantial additions while streamlining the process for minor corrections.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository uses structured issue templates for different types of contributions:\n\n- **Question template**: For general inquiries about the course content\n- **Bug report template**: Specifically for reporting issues with hands-on exercises\n- **Improvement suggestion template**: For proposing course improvements or new sections\n\nEach template includes:\n- Specific title formatting (e.g., \"[QUESTION]\", \"[HANDS-ON BUG]\", \"[UPDATE]\")\n- Automatic labeling for easier categorization\n- Clear sections guiding contributors on what information to provide\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nBased on the limited files available, only minimal style guidelines could be identified:\n\n- Structured templates with YAML front matter\n- Consistent formatting with clear headers and sections\n- Direct, concise instruction style\n- Markdown formatting for emphasis (bold text with ** **)\n\n*Note: Comprehensive coding style guidelines could not be determined without access to actual code files.*\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nNo specific commit message conventions are enforced in this repository. The standard Git hook sample files are present but not customized or activated, indicating that the team does not enforce any particular commit message format through automated means.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\n## Overview\n\nThis project appears to have limited documented non-functional specifications, with the primary focus being on multi-language support and translation processes.\n\n## Maintainability Goals\n\nThe repository shows evidence of structured approaches to translation and internationalization, which suggests a commitment to making the codebase accessible and maintainable across different languages and regions. This is demonstrated through:\n\n- Translation agreements for Russian (and potentially other languages)\n- Dedicated scripts for managing translations\n- Organized structure for handling multi-language support\n\nThe presence of translation agreements and specialized scripts indicates a systematic approach to maintaining the project across different languages, which is a key aspect of the project's maintainability strategy.",
