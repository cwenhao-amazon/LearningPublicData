    "summary": "# Technical Stack Overview\n\nThis repository appears to be focused on academic paper writing, utilizing LaTeX for document preparation with Python for data visualization and analysis. The project emphasizes structured academic writing with specific formatting guidelines and visualization preferences.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Python**: Used primarily for data visualization and analysis\n- **LaTeX**: The core technology for document preparation, with extensive use of specialized packages including:\n  - booktabs\n  - natbib\n  - cleveref\n  - algorithmicx\n  \nThe repository contains LaTeX syntax examples like `\\citet`, `\\citep`, and various formatting commands, indicating a focus on academic paper writing with proper citation and formatting standards.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n- **Data Visualization Libraries**:\n  - **Seaborn**: Python visualization library based on matplotlib\n  - **Plotly**: Interactive plotting library\n  - **Altair**: Declarative statistical visualization library\n  \nThese libraries are specifically recommended for creating graphs and visualizations in academic papers, suggesting the repository supports data-driven research papers that require effective visualization of results.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Used for version control of the repository content\n\nThe presence of standard Git directory structure (.git/config, HEAD, index, refs) confirms Git is being used to track changes in the project.\n\nThis repository appears to be a template or guide for academic writing, focusing on LaTeX document preparation with Python-based data visualization tools rather than a software development project.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be focused on academic paper writing using LaTeX rather than traditional software development. The team has established specific guidelines for academic writing while using standard version control practices.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses a standard Git-based workflow with:\n- Main branch (not master) as the primary branch\n- Remote repository collaboration through origin\n- Standard Git branch management\n\nThis suggests a modern Git approach, though without specific branching strategies documented.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository contains detailed **LaTeX Academic Paper Style Guidelines** rather than traditional programming language style guides. These guidelines cover:\n\n### Document Structure\n- Specific sections required: Introduction, Background, Model, Training, Methods, Results, Discussion, Conclusion\n- Abstracts should be 1 paragraph following Context, Problem, Idea 1, Idea 2, Results format\n- Section titles should use starting-caps\n- 8 pages is a hard limit\n\n### Typography and Formatting\n- Use present tense almost everywhere\n- Use \\`\\` '' for quotes, not \" \"\n- Use italics for new technical terms, use bold sparingly\n- Tables/figures should always float, never inline\n- Figures should have white backgrounds and large fonts\n\n### LaTeX Package Usage\n- Use booktabs for tables\n- Use natbib for citations (\\\\citet for citations as nouns, \\\\citep for end citations)\n- Use cleveref for references\n- Use algorithmicx for algorithms\n- Use seaborn, plotly or altair for graphs\n\n### Special Commands\n- `\\newcommand{\\todo}[1]{{\\small\\color{red}{\\bf [*** Todo: #1]}}}` for inline comments\n- Turn off `\\usepackage[review]{emnlp}` to `\\usepackage[]{emnlp}` while editing\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository has minimal PR guidance, with only a basic mention in the README: \"(Work in progress, send a PR!)\". This suggests the team accepts pull requests but hasn't formalized specific guidelines for their format or process.",

The repository contains a README.md file that serves as a style guide for academic paper writing, focusing on LaTeX formatting and academic writing conventions.\n\nThe repository documentation does not address software engineering concerns such as:\n\n- Performance requirements\n- Scalability expectations\n- Security standards\n- Maintainability goals\n- Resource constraints\n- Testing parameters\n- Caching strategies\n- Logging requirements\n- Audit trail requirements\n- Network requirements\n\nThis suggests that the repository is likely an academic writing template or guide rather than a software project with defined non-functional requirements.",
