    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be primarily focused on documentation for language model evaluation, specifically for the Open LLM Leaderboard. Below is a summary of the key technologies and frameworks identified in the repository.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nThe repository primarily uses:\n- **YAML** - Extensively used in GitHub workflow files to define CI/CD pipelines for documentation building\n- **Markdown** - Used for writing documentation content in the docs/source directory\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **GitHub Pages** - Used for hosting the documentation\n- The workflow files indicate a documentation deployment process that likely publishes to GitHub Pages\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **GitHub Actions with doc-builder** - The repository leverages Hugging Face's doc-builder workflows for documentation building and deployment\n- The build process includes specific parameters:\n  - Package name: \"leaderboards\"\n  - Language: \"en\"\n  - Uses the `--not_python_module` flag, suggesting this is a documentation-only repository rather than a code package\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions** - Used for continuous integration and deployment\n- Multiple workflow files exist for different documentation-related tasks:\n  - `doc-build.yml`\n  - `doc-pr-build.yml`\n  - `doc-pr-upload.yml`\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n- **EleutherAI Language Model Evaluation Harness** - The primary framework used for evaluating language models\n- The Open LLM Leaderboard uses this framework to evaluate models across multiple benchmarks:\n  - IFEval\n  - BBH\n  - MATH\n  - GPQA\n  - MuSR\n  - MMLU-PRO\n- This framework provides a unified approach to testing generative language models on various evaluation tasks\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git** - Used for version control, as evidenced by the presence of the .git directory and .gitignore file\n\nThe repository appears to be primarily focused on documentation for language model evaluation benchmarks rather than containing actual implementation code. It uses GitHub's infrastructure for both hosting the code and deploying the documentation.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository is primarily documentation-focused, with a clear organizational structure and automated workflows to support documentation development and review. The team has established specific processes for handling documentation changes through pull requests, with an emphasis on preview capabilities to ensure quality.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a **documentation-centric structure with topic-based organization**. The main organization is visible in the `_toctree.yml` file, which shows a hierarchical structure divided into two main sections:\n\n- \"Leaderboards on the Hub\"\n- \"Open LLM Leaderboard\"\n\nEach section contains multiple pages organized by topic (introduction, finding, building, etc. for the first section; about, FAQ, normalization, etc. for the second). The documentation is stored in a `docs/source/en` directory structure, suggesting internationalization support with English as the primary language. The `index.md` serves as the landing page that introduces the two main sections of the documentation.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses **GitHub Flow with automated documentation builds**. The workflow is designed specifically to handle documentation changes efficiently:\n\n- When pull requests affect documentation files (`docs/source/**`, `assets/**`), an automated build process is triggered\n- Concurrency controls cancel in-progress builds when new commits are pushed to the same PR\n- After documentation is built for a PR, a separate workflow uploads it for preview\n- The main branch appears to be the primary branch for production documentation\n- Special handling exists for `doc-builder*` branches and version release branches (`v*-release`)\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team implements **automated documentation preview for PRs** as a key part of their review process:\n\n- When a PR changes documentation files, the `doc-pr-build.yml` workflow builds the documentation\n- The `doc-pr-upload.yml` workflow then uploads it for preview\n- The system appears to automatically comment on PRs with links to the preview\n- This approach allows reviewers to see the rendered documentation before approving changes\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows **documentation-focused PR workflows** with:\n\n- Automatic processing of PRs that modify documentation-related paths\n- Specific workflows for building documentation from PRs and uploading the built documentation\n- An organized approach to handling documentation changes through PRs with automated building and preview capabilities\n\nWhile there aren't explicit style guidelines mentioned in the repository, the workflows suggest documentation changes are a key focus of the PR process.",

    "summary": "# Non-Functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the repository analysis, there are no explicit non-functional specifications documented in the repository. The repository does not contain information about performance requirements, scalability expectations, security standards, maintainability goals, or any of the other non-functional aspects that were searched for.\n\nThis suggests that the project either:\n\n1. Has these specifications documented elsewhere (perhaps in a separate system or documentation repository)\n2. Is still in early development and these specifications have not yet been defined\n3. Is operating with implicit rather than explicit non-functional requirements\n\nFor projects lacking documented non-functional specifications, it's generally recommended to:\n\n- Establish clear performance baselines and targets\n- Define security requirements, especially if handling sensitive data\n- Consider browser/device compatibility requirements\n- Document any memory/CPU constraints\n- Establish logging and monitoring requirements\n\nThese specifications are important for guiding development and ensuring the application meets unstated but expected requirements.",
