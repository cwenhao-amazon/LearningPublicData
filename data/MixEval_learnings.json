    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary for mix_eval Repository\n\nThis repository is primarily a Python-based framework for evaluating and interacting with various Large Language Models (LLMs). It provides a unified interface for working with different model providers, with particular focus on OpenAI's API integration.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Python**: The primary language used throughout the codebase\n- Evidenced by numerous `.py` files and standard Python package structure with `__init__.py` files\n- Follows Python module organization patterns\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n- **Python with OpenAI API integration**\n- Implements custom wrappers around the OpenAI client\n- Features include:\n  - Exponential backoff for rate limit handling\n  - Parallel processing with ThreadPoolExecutor\n  - Structured response handling\n  - Environment variable configuration for API URLs and keys\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\n- **REST API with Factory Pattern and Decorator Pattern**\n- Key design patterns implemented:\n  1. **REST API**: Interacts with OpenAI's REST endpoints through the OpenAI client\n  2. **Factory Pattern**: Uses a model registry to dynamically instantiate appropriate model classes\n  3. **Decorator Pattern**: `@register_model` decorator for registering model implementations\n  4. **Base Class Pattern**: Common interface through `APIModelBase` that specific implementations inherit from\n- This architecture provides flexibility in model selection and standardized interaction\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Python setuptools with pip**\n- Package configuration defined in `setup.py` using setuptools:\n  - Defines package metadata, dependencies, and entry points\n  - Uses `find_packages()` for automatic package discovery\n- `setup.sh` script for installation that:\n  - Installs PyTorch with specific CUDA version\n  - Installs the package in development mode\n  - Configures flash-attn with specific build options\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **Python package management (likely pip)**\n- Standard Python dependency management through `setup.py`\n- Environment variable management through `.env` file\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n- **Various LLM frameworks and models**\n- Supports multiple large language models including:\n  - GPT-4o\n  - LLaMA 3 (70B)\n  - Vicuna 7B\n  - Qwen 15/18B\n  - Gemini Pro\n- Designed for evaluation and comparison of different LLM implementations\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**\n- Standard Git configuration with `.gitignore` for excluding files from version control",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the MixEval team based on repository analysis. The team demonstrates a structured and methodical approach to software development with clear organization patterns and coding standards.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe MixEval repository follows a well-structured modular Python package design with clear separation of concerns:\n\n- Organized into distinct modules:\n  - `models`: Contains model implementations\n  - `utils`: Utility functions and helpers\n  - `prompts`: Prompt templates and configurations\n  - `api`: API interfaces and implementations\n\nThis structure demonstrates a thoughtful approach to code organization that promotes maintainability and scalability.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses Git with pre-commit and pre-push hooks to maintain code quality:\n\n- **Pre-push hooks**: Prevent pushing commits with \"WIP\" (work in progress) messages, ensuring only completed work is shared\n- **Pre-commit hooks**: Check for non-ASCII filenames and whitespace errors before allowing commits\n- **Prepare-commit-msg hooks**: Available for automatically modifying commit messages\n\nThese hooks suggest a workflow that emphasizes code quality and preventing accidental pushes of incomplete work, though they appear to be sample files rather than active hooks.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows comprehensive coding style guidelines:\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- **Variables/Functions**: Snake_case (e.g., `get_responses`, `chunk_generate`)\n- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `ModelBase`, `ChatModel`)\n- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `SYSTEM_MESSAGE`, `FIVE_SHOT_PREFIX_FREEFORM`)\n\n### Formatting\n- 4 spaces for indentation\n- Blank lines between logical sections and method definitions\n- Spaces around operators and after commas\n\n### Documentation\n- Triple quotes (`'''`) for module-level and function-level docstrings\n- Single-line comments with `#` for explaining complex logic or TODOs\n- Docstrings explain function purpose, parameters, and return values\n\n### Code Structure\n- Functions focus on single responsibilities\n- Detailed docstrings for complex functions\n- Lambda functions for simple transformations\n- Classes organized with initialization methods first, followed by utility methods\n- Inheritance for shared functionality\n\n### Error Handling\n- Detailed error messages with context information\n- Errors logged to files with descriptive messages\n- Validation checks with appropriate error messages\n\n### File Organization\n- Grouped imports: standard library, third-party, local modules\n- Constants and configuration at the top of files\n- Main execution code in `if __name__ == '__main__'` block\n\n### Type Annotations\n- Type hints for function parameters and return values\n- Complex types using the `typing` module (e.g., `List[str]`, `Any`)\n\nThe team's coding style guidelines demonstrate a commitment to code readability, maintainability, and consistency across the codebase.",
