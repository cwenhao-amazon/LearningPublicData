    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be focused on natural language processing (NLP) research, specifically evaluating and testing language models like OpenAI GPT and BERT. The project is primarily built with Python and uses Git for version control.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the primary programming language used throughout the project. The repository contains numerous Python scripts (.py files) that handle various tasks related to language model evaluation and testing, including:\n\n- `eval_openai_gpt.py` and `eval_bert.py` for evaluating language models\n- Various table generation scripts (`gen_lgd_tbl.py`, `gen_marvin_tbl.py`, `gen_gul_tbl.py`)\n- OpenAI GPT-specific versions of these generation scripts\n- Utility scripts like `utils.py` and `inflect.py`\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe project heavily utilizes two major NLP frameworks:\n\n1. **OpenAI GPT** - Multiple files reference and work with OpenAI's GPT models:\n   - `eval_openai_gpt.py` for evaluation\n   - `run_openai_gpt.sh` likely for running inference\n   - Several table generation scripts with OpenAI GPT variants (`gen_lgd_tbl_openai_gpt.py`, `gen_gul_tbl_openai_gpt.py`, `gen_marvin_tbl_openai_gpt.py`)\n\n2. **BERT** - The project also works with BERT models:\n   - `eval_bert.py` for evaluation\n\nThe presence of both frameworks suggests the repository might be comparing or benchmarking these different language models, possibly on linguistic tasks related to the tables being generated.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\nGit is used for version control in this project, as evidenced by:\n- The presence of a `.git` directory with standard Git files (index, HEAD, config)\n- A `.gitignore` file to specify intentionally untracked files",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a machine learning or NLP-focused project with minimal established team preferences documented. Based on the available information, the team maintains a fairly standard development environment without extensive customization of workflows or processes.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository includes standard Git commit message hooks, specifically the default `commit-msg.sample` hook that comes with Git installations. This hook is designed to check for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines in commit messages, but it remains in its sample form (not renamed to `commit-msg`), indicating it hasn't been activated.\n\nThe presence of only default Git hooks suggests the team hasn't implemented custom commit message formatting requirements or automated validation processes for their version control workflow.\n\n*Note: The repository contains Python files related to evaluation and generation tasks (utils.py, gen_lgd_tbl.py, gen_marvin_tbl.py, gen_gul_tbl.py, eval_openai_gpt.py, eval_bert.py), suggesting this is likely a machine learning project involving model evaluation and data generation, possibly comparing different models like OpenAI GPT and BERT.*",

The analysis did not identify any documented requirements for:\n\n- Performance requirements\n- Scalability expectations\n- Security standards\n- Maintainability goals\n- Memory/CPU constraints\n- Load testing parameters\n- Caching strategies\n- Logging requirements\n- Audit trail requirements\n- Network requirements\n\nThis suggests that the project may:\n- Be in early development stages where non-functional requirements haven't been formalized\n- Have these specifications documented outside the repository\n- Rely on implicit understanding or default practices for these aspects\n- Need further development of non-functional specifications to ensure quality and reliability\n\nIt would be beneficial for the project to document these non-functional requirements to guide development efforts and ensure the system meets expected quality attributes.",
