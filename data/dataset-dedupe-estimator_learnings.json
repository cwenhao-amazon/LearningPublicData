    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository is a multi-language project primarily built with Rust and Python, focusing on data processing with SQLite and Parquet file formats. The project uses modern build and package management tools specific to each language ecosystem, with Git for version control and GitHub Actions for CI/CD.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Rust**: Primary language used for core functionality\n  - Evidenced by source files in `src/` directory (lib.rs, store.rs, show.rs)\n  - Managed through Cargo build system\n  \n- **Python**: Used for additional tooling and utilities\n  - Located in the `de/` directory (cli.py, estimate.py, fileutils.py, synthetic.py)\n  - Modern Python packaging approach with pyproject.toml\n\n## Database Systems\n\n- **SQLite**: Used for data storage\n  - Multiple SQLite files referenced in the synthetic directory\n  - Example files: s1c1e1-none-original.sqlite.png, s4c1e2-none-original.sqlite.png\n  \n- **Parquet**: Used for data processing and analysis\n  - Several notebooks dedicated to Parquet with Change Data Capture (CDC)\n  - Notebooks include parquet-cdc.ipynb, parquet-cdc.md, and parquet-cdc.qmd\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Cargo**: Used as the build system for Rust components\n  - Evidenced by Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files\n  - Handles compilation and dependency management for Rust code\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **Cargo**: Manages Rust dependencies\n  - Defined in Cargo.toml with locked versions in Cargo.lock\n  \n- **pip/Python packaging**: Manages Python dependencies\n  - Modern approach using pyproject.toml for Python package configuration\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and deployment\n  - Configured in .github/workflows/CI.yml\n  - Automates testing and build processes\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Used for source code version control\n  - Standard Git configuration (.git/config)\n  - Project includes a .gitignore file for excluding files from version control",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team follows a streamlined version control workflow with a focus on automated CI/CD processes:\n\n- **Primary Workflow**: GitHub Actions CI workflow with trunk-based development\n- **Main Branches**: \"main\" and \"master\"\n- **Development Approach**: Developers create pull requests against the main branch\n- **Release Process**: Releases are created by pushing tags\n\n### CI/CD Automation\n\nThe team has established a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline that:\n- Runs on multiple platforms (Linux, Windows, macOS)\n- Tests across different architectures\n- Automatically releases to PyPI when tags are pushed\n- Can be manually triggered via workflow_dispatch\n\n### Trigger Events\n\nThe CI workflow is activated on:\n- Pushes to main/master branches\n- Any tag pushes\n- Pull requests\n- Manual triggers\n\nThis streamlined approach suggests the team values simplicity in their version control strategy, avoiding complex GitFlow or feature branch strategies at the CI level.",

The repository appears to be focused on Parquet CDC (Change Data Capture) functionality, but no specific non-functional requirements were documented in the repository.\n\nThe repository seems to be primarily focused on technical documentation and examples rather than defining non-functional specifications. No explicit information was provided for any of the non-functional specification categories in the data.",
