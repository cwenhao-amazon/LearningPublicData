    "summary": "# ML-Agents Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis document summarizes the team preferences and working style for the ML-Agents repository, which is organized as a modular system with separate Python and Unity components.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe ML-Agents codebase follows a modular package structure with clear separation of concerns:\n\n- `ml-agents/` - Core Python library\n- `ml-agents-envs/` - Environment interfaces\n- `com.unity.ml-agents/` - Unity package\n- `com.unity.ml-agents.extensions/` - Extensions for the Unity package\n\nEach module has a distinct responsibility and structure, allowing for better maintainability and separation of concerns.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses a GitHub Pull Request workflow with structured templates. The PR process is formalized through a template that enforces consistent documentation of changes, including:\n\n1. Description of proposed changes\n2. Links to related issues/tickets\n3. Categorization of change types (bug fix, new feature, refactor, etc.)\n4. Verification checklist for tests, documentation, and changelog updates\n5. Additional comments section\n\nThis indicates a formal review process where contributors must provide context and verify completion of necessary steps before submission.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team maintains comprehensive coding style guidelines for both Python and C# code:\n\n### General Formatting\n- Spaces for indentation (4 spaces for most files, 2 spaces for JSON, markdown, and project files)\n- UTF-8 encoding without BOM\n- Final newline at end of files\n- Trimmed trailing whitespace (except in markdown)\n- Line length: 88 characters for code (enforced by Black), 120 characters for comments/docstrings\n\n### Python-Specific Guidelines\n- Code formatting enforced by Black (version 19.3b0)\n- Type checking with MyPy using `--disallow-incomplete-defs` flag\n- Python 3.6+ features (enforced by pyupgrade)\n- Linting with Flake8 and additional plugins\n- Specific module usage guidelines:\n  - Use `mlagents.tf_utils` instead of direct TensorFlow imports\n  - Use `mlagents_envs.logging_util` instead of Python's logging\n  - Use `mlagents.torch_utils` instead of direct PyTorch imports\n\n### C# Guidelines\n- 4 spaces indentation\n- `dotnet-format` for whitespace formatting\n- Unity's C# coding conventions\n\n### File Organization\n- Proper module structure with validated `__init__.py` files\n- Separate test files in dedicated test directories\n- Consistent version numbers across packages\n\n### Documentation and Version Control\n- 2-space indentation for Markdown files\n- Link validation in documentation\n- LF line endings\n- Merge conflict checking\n- YAML file validation\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nPull requests follow a structured template approach that ensures consistency and quality:\n\n1. **Description Format**: Clear description of changes required\n2. **Linking Requirements**: Links to related issues, JIRA tickets, or forum threads\n3. **Change Categorization**: Changes must be categorized using checkboxes\n4. **Verification Checklist**: Confirmation of tests, documentation updates, and changelog maintenance\n5. **Additional Comments**: Space for other relevant information\n\nThis structured approach facilitates easier review and tracking of changes while maintaining quality standards.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses structured issue templates for bug reports and feature requests, standardizing how issues are reported and tracked. This helps ensure that necessary information is provided when issues are created.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nCode reviews follow a checklist-based approach that ensures:\n\n1. Changes are properly categorized\n2. Tests verify the effectiveness of fixes or new features\n3. Documentation is updated when applicable\n4. Changelog is maintained for tracking changes\n5. Migration guides are updated for breaking changes\n\nThis standardized review process helps maintain quality and consistency across the project.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team emphasizes comprehensive testing with both unit and integration tests for Python and C# components. The extensive test directories in both `ml-agents/mlagents/trainers/tests/` and `com.unity.ml-agents/Tests/` demonstrate a strong commitment to code quality and reliability through testing.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications for ML-Agents Repository\n\nThis document summarizes the identified non-functional specifications for the ML-Agents repository, focusing on key aspects that define the system's operational characteristics beyond its functional features.\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\nThe ML-Agents repository demonstrates a clear focus on neural network optimization and efficient tensor operations:\n\n- **Optimized Tensor Operations**: The ModelUtils class implements methods for converting between numpy arrays and PyTorch tensors that are \"MUCH faster than calling as_tensor on the list directly\"\n- **Neural Network Architecture Optimization**: Various encoder types (SimpleVisualEncoder, ResNetVisualEncoder, etc.) are available with specific minimum resolution requirements for each\n- **Visual Encoder Selection**: The system allows different visual encoder types to be selected based on performance needs\n- **Memory-Efficient Design**: Careful handling of tensor conversions and data structures indicates a focus on memory efficiency throughout the machine learning pipeline\n\nWhile no explicit numerical performance targets are documented, the codebase shows consistent attention to computational efficiency in the machine learning operations.\n\n## Memory/CPU Constraints\n\nThe repository implements adaptive CPU thread management with container awareness:\n\n- **Dynamic Thread Allocation**: The system automatically determines optimal thread count based on available CPU resources, defaulting to half the available cores up to a maximum of 4 threads\n- **Container Environment Detection**: Special handling for containerized environments (Docker) through cgroup information reading\n- **Kubernetes Compatibility**: Specific support for Kubernetes environments, interpreting CPU shares according to Kubernetes conventions (1024 shares = 1 CPU)\n- **Graceful Fallback**: If container-specific information isn't available, the system falls back to using the system's CPU count\n\nThis sophisticated approach ensures the system can run efficiently across various deployment environments, from resource-constrained containers to full servers, with automatic resource usage adaptation.\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nThe repository implements a customizable logging system with multiple detail levels:\n\n- **Comprehensive Log Levels**: Support for standard Python logging levels (CRITICAL, FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, NOTSET)\n- **Context-Sensitive Formatting**: Log format changes based on level - DEBUG includes timestamps, filenames, and line numbers, while other levels use a simpler format\n- **Centralized Logger Registry**: Maintains a registry of loggers to enable global log level changes\n- **Standard Output Direction**: All logs are directed to stdout rather than files\n- **Uniform Formatting**: Enforces consistent formatting across all system loggers\n\nThis implementation suggests a requirement for flexible logging that can transition between detailed debugging information and more concise operational logs while maintaining a consistent interface.",
