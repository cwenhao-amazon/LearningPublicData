    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository is a Python-based emulator for Hugging Face Endpoints, built with Starlette as the web framework and Uvicorn as the ASGI server. It provides a REST API for machine learning model inference, with a focus on emulating the behavior of Hugging Face's hosted inference endpoints locally. The project uses standard Python packaging tools and Git for version control, with GitHub Actions for CI/CD.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the sole programming language used in this project, as evidenced by the standard Python project structure including:\n- `setup.py` for package configuration\n- `pyproject.toml` for packaging metadata\n- Python modules in the `src/hf_endpoints_emulator/` directory\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\nThe project uses a combination of:\n- **Starlette**: An ASGI framework used to build the web application\n- **Uvicorn**: An ASGI server that runs the application\n\nThe main application in `emulator.py` creates a Starlette app with defined routes for health checks and prediction endpoints. The server is run using Uvicorn with the configuration:\n```python\nuvicorn.run(app, port=port, host=\"0.0.0.0\", log_level=\"info\")\n```\n\nThe application is designed to load custom handlers for inference endpoints and process HTTP requests.\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\nThe project implements a **REST API** pattern with clearly defined endpoints and HTTP methods:\n- GET requests to \"/\" and \"/health\" for health checks\n- POST requests to \"/\" and \"/predict\" for prediction functionality\n\nThe API follows REST conventions:\n- Accepts JSON input with an \"inputs\" key\n- Returns JSON responses\n- Implements proper error handling with appropriate HTTP status codes (400 for bad requests)\n- Returns error messages in JSON format\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n**Pytest** is used as the testing framework, as indicated by:\n- Dependencies listed in `setup.py` including \"pytest\", \"pytest-xdist\", and \"pytest-sugar\"\n- Makefile commands for running tests with pytest:\n  ```\n  python3 -m pytest -s -v ./tests/unit\n  python3 -m pytest -s -v ./tests/integ/\n  ```\n\n## Build Systems\n\nThe project uses **setuptools with Make**:\n- **setuptools** serves as the primary build system (via `setup.py`)\n- **Make** is used for development tasks like running tests and code quality checks\n\nThe Makefile defines targets for unit-test, integ-test, quality, and style checks, providing a streamlined development workflow.\n\n## Package Management\n\nStandard **Python package management** tools are used:\n- `setup.py` for defining package metadata and dependencies\n- `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging configuration\n- `setup.cfg` for additional package configuration\n\nThese files together enable distribution via PyPI and installation via pip.\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n**GitHub Actions** is used for continuous integration and deployment, as evidenced by:\n- Workflow file at `.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yaml`\n- Automated publishing to PyPI\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nInterestingly, the project doesn't explicitly use any specific machine learning framework. While it's designed to work with machine learning models (as indicated by the `EndpointHandler` class and comments like `# self.model= load_model(path)`), the system appears to be framework-agnostic. It's designed to load and run inference with custom handlers that could potentially use any ML framework.\n\nThe setup files mention \"transformers\" in comments and list it as a known third-party package, but the actual code doesn't import or use TensorFlow, PyTorch, or any other ML framework directly.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as indicated by:\n- The presence of a `.git/` directory\n- A `.gitignore` file for specifying intentionally untracked files",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach identified in the Hugging Face Endpoints Emulator repository. The team follows modern Python development practices with a focus on code quality and automation.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a standard Python package structure with src layout:\n- Main package code in `src/hf_endpoints_emulator/`\n- Example code in a separate `examples/` directory\n\nThis modern Python project structure effectively separates source code from examples and tests, following best practices for Python package development.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team maintains strict coding style guidelines enforced through automated tools:\n\n### Formatting and Line Length\n- Maximum line length: 119 characters\n- Black formatter with Python 3.9 target\n- Newlines before comments\n- Parentheses for line continuations\n\n### Import Formatting\n- isort for import organization\n- Imports grouped in sections: standard library, third-party, first-party\n- Trailing commas in multi-line imports\n- Force grid wrap: 0\n- Multi-line output style: 3 (vertical hanging indent)\n- Two blank lines after imports\n\n### Linting\n- flake8 with specific ignored rules:\n  - E203: Whitespace before ':'\n  - E501: Line too long\n  - E741: Ambiguous variable name\n  - W503: Line break before binary operator\n  - W605: Invalid escape sequence\n\nThese guidelines are enforced through configuration in `setup.cfg` and `pyproject.toml`, suggesting a strong emphasis on code readability and consistency across the codebase.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses GitHub Flow with automated PyPI publishing:\n- GitHub Actions workflow for automatic package publishing to PyPI\n- Main branch serves as the source of truth\n- Automated deployments from the main branch\n- Sample pre-commit and pre-push hooks suggest quality checks before code submission\n\nThis workflow indicates a streamlined approach to continuous integration and deployment, with an emphasis on maintaining a high-quality main branch that's always in a deployable state.",
