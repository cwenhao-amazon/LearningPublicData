    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working preferences and standards identified in the repository. The team appears to have a standard Git-based workflow with potential for enforcing quality standards through hooks, though many of these mechanisms remain in their sample state rather than being actively implemented.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses a standard Git workflow with sample hooks available for enforcing commit quality. These hooks include:\n\n- **pre-commit.sample**: Checks for non-ASCII filenames and whitespace errors before commits\n- **commit-msg.sample**: Validates commit messages and checks for duplicate Signed-off-by lines\n- **pre-push.sample**: Prevents pushing commits with messages starting with \"WIP\" (work in progress)\n- **pre-rebase.sample**: Prevents rebasing branches that have already been published\n- **prepare-commit-msg.sample**: Modifies commit messages before they're finalized\n\nThese hooks are currently in their sample state and would need to be renamed (removing the .sample extension) to be activated.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository demonstrates consistent coding style guidelines, particularly for shell scripts:\n\n### Shell Script Conventions\n- Comprehensive header comments explaining script purpose\n- 2-space indentation in shell scripts\n- Consistent use of if/then/else/fi block structure\n- Variable assignment without spaces around equals sign\n- Proper error message formatting with heredocs (<<\\EOF)\n\n### Git Configuration Practices\n- Enforcement of ASCII-only filenames\n- Whitespace error checking\n- Use of git configuration for customizing behavior\n\n### Error Handling\n- Clear error messages with explanations and remediation steps\n- Non-zero exit codes for failures\n- Stderr redirection for error output\n\n### Code Organization\n- Logical flow with initialization, validation, and execution phases\n- Comments explaining non-obvious operations\n- Consistent command output redirection patterns\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nWhile no specific commit message format is actively enforced, the infrastructure exists for validation through Git hooks. The repository includes:\n\n- **commit-msg.sample**: Currently only checks for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines\n- **prepare-commit-msg.sample**: Could be configured to include git diff output or add \"Signed-off-by\" lines\n\nThese hooks are available but not activated, suggesting that while the team has considered message standardization, they haven't implemented strict requirements.",
