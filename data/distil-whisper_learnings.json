    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository represents a machine learning project with a focus on audio transcription, specifically related to the Whisper model. Below is a summary of the key technologies and frameworks used in this project.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n**Python** is the primary programming language used throughout the repository. This is evidenced by numerous Python files (.py extensions), setup.py files, and pyproject.toml configuration files. The entire codebase appears to be written in Python, which is a common choice for machine learning projects due to its rich ecosystem of libraries and frameworks.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe project utilizes two major machine learning frameworks:\n\n- **JAX/Flax**: The project heavily uses Flax, which is a neural network library built on top of JAX. This is evidenced by the dedicated flax directory and files like `modeling_flax_whisper.py`.\n\n- **PyTorch**: There are references to PyTorch (abbreviated as \"pt\") in several file names such as `run_pt_long_form_transcription.py` and `run_speed_pt.py`, indicating that PyTorch is also used in parts of the project.\n\nThis dual-framework approach suggests the project may be comparing implementations or leveraging specific strengths of each framework.\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n**TPU** (Tensor Processing Units) are used for training models in this project, as indicated by the presence of `tpu_connect.sh`. TPUs are specialized hardware accelerators developed by Google specifically for machine learning workloads, particularly effective for training large models.\n\n## Build Systems\n\n**Make** is used as a build system or task runner in the project, as evidenced by Makefiles in multiple directories. Make provides a way to define and run tasks with dependencies, which is useful for automating common development workflows.\n\n## Package Management\n\n**pip** is the package management tool used in this project, as indicated by standard Python package management files:\n- `setup.py`\n- `pyproject.toml`\n- `requirements.txt`\n\nThese files define the project's dependencies and make it installable as a Python package.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as shown by the presence of a `.git` directory with standard Git configuration files. This allows for tracking changes, collaborating with other developers, and managing different versions of the codebase.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working practices for the repository, based on the available information.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular approach to code organization, with clear separation of concerns through directory structure:\n\n- Code is organized into logical directories based on functionality\n- Core model code is contained in the `distil_whisper` directory\n- Separate directories exist for specific script types:\n  - `distillation_scripts/` for model distillation\n  - `evaluation_scripts/` for model evaluation\n  - `finetuning_scripts/` for model fine-tuning\n\nThis structure suggests a well-organized codebase that prioritizes maintainability and clear separation of different functional components.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository includes standard Git commit message hooks, specifically the sample commit-msg hook that comes with Git installations. This hook is not actively enforced (still has the .sample extension) but indicates awareness of commit message standards.\n\nThe sample hook provides:\n- Validation for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines\n- Potential for adding \"Signed-off-by\" lines automatically (commented code)\n\nWhile not customized, the presence of these samples suggests the team may be considering implementing more structured commit message guidelines in the future.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\n## Performance Requirements\n- **Focus on model speed and efficiency**: Multiple scripts are dedicated to measuring and optimizing speed performance, indicating a strong focus on model efficiency and latency. This is evidenced by the presence of dedicated speed measurement scripts in the repository.\n\nThe project appears to prioritize performance optimization, particularly in terms of model speed and efficiency. This is demonstrated by the presence of multiple scripts dedicated to measuring and optimizing speed performance. The repository contains specific scripts for speed measurement, which suggests that model efficiency and latency are important for this project.",
