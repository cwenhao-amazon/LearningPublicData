    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository is primarily a Python-based project focused on interacting with the Hugging Face ecosystem. It contains scripts for managing Hugging Face Spaces, scraping model information, and processing datasets with asynchronous API calls. The project leverages Hugging Face libraries for API interactions and uses CSV files for data storage.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the primary programming language used throughout the repository. Multiple Python scripts are found in different directories, including:\n- `delete_spaces_batch/run.py`\n- `featured_spaces_likes/run.py`\n- `model_scraping/run.py`\n- `async_api_scrapes/run.py`\n- `async_api_scrapes/prepare_dataset.py`\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\nThe backend is built with **Python and Hugging Face libraries**, specifically:\n\n- **huggingface_hub**: Used for API interactions with Hugging Face Hub (listing spaces, deleting repos, fetching model information)\n- **datasets**: Used for loading and processing datasets\n- **pandas**: Used for data manipulation and CSV handling\n- **asyncio and aiohttp**: Used for asynchronous API calls\n\nThese libraries enable various operations like deleting spaces, fetching likes for spaces, scraping model information, and processing datasets with asynchronous API calls.\n\n## Database Systems\n\nRather than using a traditional database system, the project uses **CSV files for data storage**. Examples include:\n- Reading data from `spaces.csv`: `df = pd.read_csv(\"spaces.csv\")`\n- Writing processed data back to CSV: `df.to_csv(\"./spaces_with_likes.csv\")`\n\nThere are also commented-out lines for JSON storage and the project uses the Hugging Face datasets library for handling larger datasets.\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\nThe project implements a **REST API with asynchronous client** pattern, as demonstrated in `async_api_scrapes/run.py`:\n\n- HTTP POST requests to REST endpoints (e.g., `https://opts-api.spawningaiapi.com/api/v2/query/urls`)\n- Authentication using API tokens in headers\n- Asynchronous client implementation using aiohttp for concurrent API calls\n- Rate limiting implementation using AsyncLimiter to control requests per second\n- Batching of requests using semaphores to limit concurrent connections\n\nThis pattern optimizes performance when making multiple API calls.\n\n## Package Management\n\n**pip** is used for Python package management, as evidenced by the presence of a `requirements.txt` file.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe repository works with **Hugging Face Transformers** models. This is shown by the numerous model card files for various transformer models in the `model_scraping/cards/` directory, including:\n- BERT variants (`bert-base-uncased`, `distilbert-base-cased-distilled-squad`)\n- RoBERTa models (`xlm-roberta-base`, `xlm-roberta-large`)\n- T5 models (`t5-base`)\n- GPT-2 (`gpt2`)\n- BART (`facebook___bart-large-mnli`)\n- Sentence transformers (`sentence-transformers___all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)\n- Stable Diffusion (`runwayml___stable-diffusion-v1-5`)\n- Translation models (`Helsinki-NLP___opus-mt-en-es`)\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as indicated by the presence of the `.git` directory and its contents (`.git/index`, `.git/description`, `.git/HEAD`, etc.).",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach identified in the repository. The team appears to follow a task-oriented structure with Python-based scripts for various automation tasks.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a task-based directory structure, with each directory representing a specific functionality:\n\n- `delete_spaces_batch`\n- `featured_spaces_likes`\n- `model_scraping`\n- `async_api_scrapes`\n\nEach directory contains its own `run.py` script, indicating a modular approach where each task is self-contained.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows consistent Python coding conventions:\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- **Variables, functions, file names**: snake_case (e.g., `fetch_models`, `model_to_dict`, `get_likes`)\n- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `ModelInfo`, `ModelCard`, `AsyncLimiter`)\n- **Constants**: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `TOKEN`, `BATCH_SIZE`, `OPT_IN_COUNT`)\n\n### Imports\n- Organized in groups: standard library, third-party packages, local modules\n- Direct imports of specific classes/functions when appropriate:\n  ```python\n  from huggingface_hub import HfApi, ModelFilter, ModelCard\n  ```\n\n### Whitespace and Formatting\n- 4 spaces for indentation\n- Blank lines between logical sections\n- No trailing whitespace\n- Reasonable line lengths (not strictly enforced)\n\n### Function Design\n- Single responsibility principle\n- Descriptive function names indicating action\n- Clearly defined return values\n\n### Comments\n- Used sparingly, mainly for explaining complex logic\n- Comment blocks used for temporarily disabled code\n\n### Code Organization\n- Standard structure:\n  1. Imports at top\n  2. Constants and configuration\n  3. Function definitions\n  4. Main execution code (often in `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block)\n\n### Error Handling\n- Minimal explicit error handling in the examples\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe repository uses Git with standard sample hooks. The presence of sample hooks (with `.sample` extension) indicates they haven't been customized or actively implemented in the workflow:\n\n- `pre-push.sample`\n- `pre-merge-commit.sample`\n- `pre-commit.sample`\n- `prepare-commit-msg.sample`\n\nNo specific branching strategy or PR template is evident from the available files.",

    "summary": "# Non-Functional Specifications Summary\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\n### Performance Requirements\n\nThe primary performance requirements for this project focus on API interaction optimization and throughput management. The system implements rate limiting and concurrency controls for API calls, with specific parameters set to balance throughput with system stability.\n\nKey specifications include:\n- Rate limiting set to 50 requests per second for API calls\n- Concurrent connections limited to 100 simultaneous requests\n- Batch processing of data in chunks of 100,000 items\n- Request chunking of 1,000 items per API call\n\nThese controls are implemented through:\n- AsyncLimiter for rate limiting\n- asyncio.Semaphore for concurrent connection control\n- Batched processing with the datasets library\n- Asynchronous API calls for improved throughput\n\nThe performance requirements demonstrate a focus on efficient data processing while respecting external API limitations. This approach allows the system to handle large datasets without overwhelming external services or internal resources.",
