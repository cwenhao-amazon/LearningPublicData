    "summary": "# Technical Stack Overview\n\nThis repository represents a Kubernetes storage orchestrator project that implements the Container Storage Interface (CSI). It's primarily built in Go and designed to run within Kubernetes environments.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Go**: The entire codebase is written in Go, as evidenced by the main.go file and Go module configuration files (go.mod, go.sum).\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n- **Kubernetes**: The project is deeply integrated with Kubernetes\n- **CSI (Container Storage Interface)**: Implements the CSI specification for container storage management\n- **REST API**: Provides RESTful interfaces for management and configuration\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\n- **REST**: Implemented in the frontend/rest directory for HTTP-based API access\n- **gRPC**: Used for communication with Kubernetes CSI components (frontend/csi/grpc.go)\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Kubernetes**: Primary runtime environment\n- **Docker**: Used for containerization (Dockerfile present)\n- **Helm**: Provides Helm charts for deployment to Kubernetes clusters\n- **Operator Pattern**: Includes a Kubernetes operator for orchestration\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **Go testing package**: Uses Go's standard testing library for unit and integration tests, with numerous test files (*_test.go) throughout the codebase\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Make**: Uses Makefile for build automation and common development tasks\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **Go Modules**: Manages dependencies through Go's native module system (go.mod, go.sum)\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **Jenkins**: Primary CI/CD pipeline defined in Jenkinsfile\n- **GitHub Actions**: Additional CI/CD workflows configured in .github/workflows\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Uses Git for version control with standard configuration (.gitignore, .git/config)",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the team based on the repository structure and documentation.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular package structure with clear separation of concerns. The codebase is organized into logical modules:\n\n- `storage_drivers/` - Handles different backend implementations\n- `frontend/` - Contains CSI and REST interfaces\n- `core/` - Houses the main orchestration logic\n- `persistent_store/` - Manages persistent storage functionality\n- `utils/` - Provides common utility functions\n\nThis organization demonstrates a thoughtful approach to software architecture, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team follows a pull request based workflow with standardized templates. This structured approach ensures consistency in code contributions and helps maintain quality standards.\n\nKey elements include:\n- Pull request templates\n- Bug report templates\n- Feature/documentation request templates\n\nThis indicates a mature development process with clear guidelines for contributing to the project.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team adheres to Go standard formatting with linting enforcement. This is implemented through:\n\n- `.golangci.yml` configuration\n- `.editorconfig` for consistent formatting\n- `hooks/golangci-lint.sh` for pre-commit linting\n\nThese tools help maintain code quality and consistency across the codebase, reducing the cognitive load during code reviews.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team employs a structured checklist approach for code reviews, as evidenced by their pull request template. The review process appears thorough, covering:\n\n- Unit testing verification\n- Functional testing requirements\n- Code review walkthroughs\n- Test coverage assessment\n- Documentation updates\n- Changelog maintenance\n- Project tracking integration\n- TODO item management\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures high-quality code contributions and maintains the overall health of the codebase.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team values comprehensive unit testing with mocks. This is demonstrated by:\n\n- Dedicated `mocks/` directory for test doubles\n- Numerous `*_test.go` files throughout the codebase\n\nThis testing approach allows components to be tested in isolation, improving test reliability and coverage.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nPull requests follow a standardized template format. This ensures that all PRs contain the necessary information for effective review and provides consistency across contributions.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses standardized issue templates for different types of contributions:\n\n- Bug report template\n- Feature or documentation request template\n\nThese templates help ensure that issues contain all the necessary information for the team to understand and address them effectively.",
