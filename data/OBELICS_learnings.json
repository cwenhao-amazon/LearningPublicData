    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a Python-based project called \"obelics\" that focuses on processing web archives (WARC files), extracting HTML content, and performing image filtering operations. The tech stack is relatively minimal based on the available information.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the primary programming language used in this project. This is evidenced by:\n- Numerous Python files (.py extension) in the build_obelics and obelics directories\n- A requirements.txt file for dependency management\n- Python module structure with __init__.py files\n\nThe project appears to be organized into processing components for tasks like downloading WARC files, extracting HTML content, and processing web documents.\n\n## Package Management\n\nThe project uses **pip** for package management, as indicated by the presence of a requirements.txt file. This is the standard package manager for Python projects and is used to specify and install dependencies.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control in this project, as evidenced by:\n- The presence of a .git directory\n- A .gitignore file for specifying files to exclude from version control\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nWhile specific frameworks aren't explicitly identified, the project appears to include machine learning capabilities, particularly for content filtering:\n- Files related to NSFW (Not Safe For Work) image filtering and removal suggest the use of machine learning techniques\n- The naming convention (07_01_nsfw_image_filtering.py, 07_03_nsfw_image_removal.py) indicates this is part of a sequential processing pipeline\n\nThe project seems to focus on processing web archives and filtering content, potentially for creating clean datasets or ensuring appropriate content.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working style based on the repository structure and organization. The team appears to be working on a Python-based project with a clear modular organization.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular organization approach with a clear separation of concerns:\n\n- Main package `obelics` contains the core functionality\n- Separate `build_obelics` directory houses build and processing scripts\n\nThe main package is further divided into specialized submodules:\n- `processors/`: Processing logic components\n- `utils/`: Utility functions and helper code\n- `visualization/`: Data visualization components\n- `callers/`: Interface or API components\n- `configs/`: Configuration files and settings\n\nThis structure demonstrates a thoughtful approach to code organization that separates different functional areas into distinct modules, making the codebase more maintainable and navigable.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows Python conventions with:\n\n- **Snake_case naming convention** for files and likely for functions\n- **Sequential execution indicators** in build scripts (numbered prefixes like `01_download_warc.py`)\n\nThe consistent use of snake_case aligns with PEP 8 Python style guidelines, suggesting the team values adherence to language standards. The numbered prefixes in build scripts indicate a deliberate approach to execution order, making the process flow clear to team members.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided repository information, there are very limited explicit non-functional specifications identified. The repository appears to contain code for parallel processing of HTML extraction and image downloading, but detailed specifications for non-functional requirements are not clearly documented.\n\nThe only potential indication of performance optimization is the presence of parallel processing in the build pipeline:\n\n- `build_obelics/02_parallel_extract_html_get_image_urls.py`\n- `build_obelics/03_parallel_dl_images_create_dataset.py`\n\nThese file names suggest that parallelization is being used to improve performance during HTML extraction, URL collection, and image downloading processes. However, without examining the actual code or documentation, specific performance requirements or targets cannot be determined.\n\nNo other non-functional specifications such as scalability expectations, security standards, maintainability goals, resource constraints, or other operational requirements were identified in the provided repository information.",
