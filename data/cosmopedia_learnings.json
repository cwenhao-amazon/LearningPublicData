    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a machine learning project focused on educational content processing, with components for text generation, classification, evaluation, and search. Here's a summary of the key technologies identified in the codebase.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the primary programming language used throughout the project. Python scripts are employed for various tasks including:\n- Evaluation (lighteval_tasks.py)\n- Text generation (llm_swarm_script.py, boilerplate_cleanup.py)\n- Classification (train_edu_bert.py, run_edu_bert.py)\n- Data deduplication (deduplicate_dataset.py)\n- Prompt building and processing (various scripts in prompts/ directory)\n\nPython's extensive libraries for machine learning and natural language processing make it an ideal choice for this type of educational content processing project.\n\n## Database Systems\n\nManticore Search is used as the full-text search engine in the project. This is evidenced by:\n- Configuration files (fulltext_search/manticore.conf)\n- Indexing scripts (fulltext_search/index_docs.py)\n- Search implementation (fulltext_search/search_sharded.py)\n\nManticore Search is likely chosen for its high-performance full-text search capabilities, which would be important for searching through educational content efficiently.\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\nSLURM (Simple Linux Utility for Resource Management) is used for job scheduling and resource management. Multiple SLURM job files are present:\n- evaluation/eval.slurm\n- classification/train_edu_bert.slurm\n- classification/run_edu_bert.slurm\n- fulltext_search/search_sharded.slurm\n- fulltext_search/index_docs.slurm\n\nThe use of SLURM suggests that the project runs in a high-performance computing environment, likely for handling computationally intensive machine learning tasks.\n\n## Package Management\n\npip is used for Python package management, as evidenced by the requirements.txt file in the prompts/khanacademy/khan_dl/ directory. This is the standard package manager for Python projects.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nBERT models (likely using Hugging Face Transformers library) are employed for classification tasks:\n- classification/train_edu_bert.py\n- classification/run_edu_bert.py\n\nThe \"edu_bert\" naming suggests that the project uses BERT models specifically fine-tuned for educational content classification, which aligns with the overall educational focus of the repository.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\nGit is used for version control, as indicated by the presence of a standard .git directory structure with typical Git files and hooks.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working style based on the repository analysis. The team appears to follow a modular, functionality-based approach to organizing their codebase.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a **module-based organization by functionality**. The repository is structured into distinct directories, each representing a specific functional domain:\n\n- `evaluation/` \n- `generation/`\n- `classification/`\n- `deduplication/`\n- `prompts/`\n- `fulltext_search/`\n\nEach module has its own README and related Python scripts, indicating a clean separation of concerns. This modular approach allows team members to work on specific functional areas with minimal interference with other parts of the codebase.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe repository contains standard Git hook templates:\n- `.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample`\n- `.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg.sample`\n- `.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample`\n- `.git/hooks/pre-push.sample`\n\nThese are the default Git hook templates and appear to be unused as they still have the `.sample` extension. The team has not yet implemented custom Git workflows through these hooks.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has the standard Git commit message hook template (`.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample`) in place, but it remains inactive as it still has the `.sample` extension. This default hook can validate commit messages and check for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines, but no custom commit message validation rules have been implemented yet.\n\nThe presence of this file suggests the team may be considering implementing standardized commit message formats in the future, but has not yet formalized this practice.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided information, there are no explicit non-functional specifications documented in the repository. The learning items provided in the input data show that various files were identified as potentially relevant to different non-functional aspects, but no concrete specifications were extracted.\n\nThe repository appears to contain SLURM job scripts and Python code related to search, classification, and evaluation functionality, but without explicit documentation of non-functional requirements or constraints.\n\nFor a more comprehensive non-functional specification, the project team should consider documenting:\n\n- Performance requirements and targets\n- Resource allocation guidelines\n- Scalability expectations\n- Maintainability standards\n- Logging and monitoring requirements\n- Security standards\n- Data retention policies\n\nThis documentation would help ensure that all team members understand the operational constraints and quality attributes the system must meet beyond its functional capabilities.",
