    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository is primarily a Python-based machine learning project focused on BERT model pruning (PruneBERT). The project uses standard Python tooling for development, testing, and distribution, with a clear focus on transformer-based machine learning models.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the primary programming language used throughout the repository. This is evidenced by:\n- Multiple Python files with `.py` extensions (setup.py, masked_run_glue.py, counts_parameters.py, etc.)\n- Jupyter notebooks (Saving_PruneBERT.ipynb) which use Python\n- The presence of requirements.txt for Python dependencies\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe project is built around Transformers, specifically BERT models:\n- Contains specialized BERT modeling files (modeling_bert_masked.py, configuration_bert_masked.py)\n- Includes scripts for running BERT models on standard NLP benchmarks:\n  - GLUE (General Language Understanding Evaluation) via masked_run_glue.py\n  - SQuAD (Stanford Question Answering Dataset) via masked_run_squad.py\n- Features a \"bertarize.py\" utility, likely for converting or optimizing BERT models\n- The project appears to focus on pruning BERT models (PruneBERT), which is a technique to reduce model size while maintaining performance\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\nThe repository uses Python's built-in testing framework:\n- Contains a tests directory with test_fun.py\n- Follows the standard Python test naming convention (test_*.py)\n- Likely uses unittest or pytest, though the specific framework isn't explicitly identified\n\n## Build Systems\n\nPython setuptools is used for building and packaging:\n- Includes setup.py for package configuration\n- Contains MANIFEST.in for specifying additional files to include in the package distribution\n\n## Package Management\n\npip is used for dependency management:\n- Requirements are specified in requirements.txt\n- This allows for easy installation of project dependencies\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\nGit is used for version control:\n- Contains .git directory and configuration\n- Includes .gitignore file for specifying files to exclude from version control",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach identified in the repository. The team appears to follow a modular code structure with minimal testing practices, though many aspects of their workflow remain undefined or undocumented.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular organization approach with separate packages for core functionality and tests. The codebase is structured as follows:\n\n- Main functionality in the `block_movement_pruning` package\n- Subpackage `emmental` containing the core model implementation\n- Further subdivision into `modules` within the emmental package\n- Separate `tests` directory for unit tests\n\nThis organization demonstrates a clean separation of concerns and follows standard Python package conventions with proper `__init__.py` files throughout the directory structure.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team implements basic unit testing with a minimal setup:\n\n- Uses Python's standard `unittest` framework\n- Contains a simple test class (`TestFun`) that inherits from `TestCase`\n- Has a single empty test method (`test_basic`)\n\nThe testing approach appears to be quite basic, with no evidence of more advanced methodologies like Test-Driven Development (TDD) or Behavior-Driven Development (BDD). The minimal nature of the test file suggests that comprehensive testing may not be a primary focus of the team's development process.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository contains a sample Git hook script (`.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample`) that would check commit messages, but it has not been activated. This indicates:\n\n- No enforced commit message standards or validation\n- The team has not implemented automated checks for commit message quality\n- The sample hook would check for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines if activated\n\nThe lack of an active commit message hook suggests the team may have an informal approach to commit message formatting and content.",

    "summary": "# Non-Functional Specifications\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\nThe repository appears to be focused on **Model weight sparsity optimization** as a key performance requirement. This is evidenced by the presence of tools for measuring and analyzing model weight sparsity optimization, as seen in the `block_movement_pruning/counts_parameters.py` file. This file is designed to measure and report the sparsity of neural network weights after pruning, calculating the percentage of remaining (non-zero) weights in a model's encoder after applying various pruning methods (L0 regularization, movement pruning, or soft movement pruning).\n\nThe presence of this tool suggests that a key performance requirement is achieving high levels of sparsity while maintaining model functionality. This approach to model optimization indicates that the project prioritizes efficient resource utilization, likely to improve inference speed and reduce model size, which is a common goal in machine learning applications where deployment efficiency matters.\n\nThe repository appears to be focused on techniques that allow for maintaining model performance while reducing computational requirements through strategic pruning of neural network weights.",
