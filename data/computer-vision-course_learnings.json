    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a machine learning project focused on computer vision and deep learning, with an emphasis on educational content through Jupyter notebooks.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n**Python** is the primary programming language used in this project. This is evident from:\n- Multiple Jupyter notebooks (.ipynb files) containing Python code\n- Python utility scripts (e.g., utils/code_formatter.py)\n- Python-related configuration files (requirements.txt, .pre-commit-config.yaml)\n\nPython is the standard choice for machine learning and data science projects due to its rich ecosystem of libraries and tools.\n\n## Package Management\n\n**pip** is used for Python package management, as indicated by:\n- The presence of requirements.txt file which lists project dependencies\n- References in the Makefile for dependency management\n\npip is the standard package manager for Python projects, making it a natural choice for managing the project's dependencies.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe project leverages several modern machine learning frameworks:\n\n**PyTorch** serves as the core deep learning framework, as seen in:\n- notebooks/Unit 9 - Model Optimization/torch.ipynb\n- Various other notebooks implementing neural network models\n\n**Hugging Face Transformers** is used for working with transformer models:\n- notebooks/Unit 3 - Vision Transformers/transfer-learning-image-classification.ipynb\n- Other transformer-related notebooks for NLP and vision tasks\n\n**timm** (PyTorch Image Models) is utilized for computer vision tasks:\n- notebooks/Unit 2 - Convolutional Neural Networks/timm_Resnet.ipynb\n- Used particularly for implementing and fine-tuning ResNet architectures\n\nThe combination of these frameworks suggests a focus on state-of-the-art computer vision and possibly multimodal machine learning approaches.\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n**GitHub Actions** is employed for continuous integration and deployment:\n- Multiple workflow files in .github/workflows/ directory:\n  - build_pr_documentation.yml\n  - quality.yml\n  - build_documentation.yml\n  - upload_pr_documentation.yml\n\nThese workflows appear to handle documentation building, code quality checks, and other automated processes.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as evidenced by:\n- The presence of .git/ directory\n- .gitignore file for specifying intentionally untracked files\n\nGit is the industry standard for version control, particularly for projects hosted on GitHub.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach for the Computer Vision Course repository. The repository is structured as an educational resource with clear organization, development workflows, and coding standards.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows an educational structure organized into units and chapters covering different computer vision topics:\n\n- **Unit 1**: Fundamentals\n- **Unit 2**: Convolutional Neural Networks\n- **Unit 3**: Vision Transformers\n\nThis organization is mirrored in both the notebooks directory and the documentation chapters, creating a parallel structure that supports the educational nature of the content.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses GitHub Flow with PR-based development, featuring:\n\n- Pull request-based development with documentation builds on PRs\n- Automated quality checks via GitHub Actions workflows\n- Code ownership rules defined in CODEOWNERS file\n- Concurrency management to cancel in-progress workflows when new commits are pushed\n\nThis structured workflow ensures changes are properly reviewed and tested before merging.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\n### General Formatting\n- Black for code formatting with a line length of 90 characters\n- Ruff for linting Python code\n- 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs)\n- No trailing whitespace\n- Files end with a newline\n- Python 3.7+ compatibility\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Snake_case for variables and functions\n- Descriptive variable names that indicate purpose\n\n### Function Design\n- Single responsibility functions\n- Docstrings or comments for complex functions\n- Type hints where appropriate\n- Reasonably sized functions\n\n### Error Handling\n- Try/except blocks for error handling\n- Informative error messages\n- Re-raising exceptions with context when appropriate\n\n### Code Organization\n- Related functionality grouped into modules\n- Imports at the top of files\n- Standard import order: standard library, third-party, local\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team implements a code ownership-based review system with designated reviewers for specific parts of the codebase:\n\n- Default owners (@merveenoyan, @johko, @burtenshaw, @sergiopaniego) for all files\n- Specific ownership defined for the /chapters/ and /notebooks/ directories\n- Pull requests that modify files in these directories require review from the specified owners\n\nThis approach ensures that changes are reviewed by team members with appropriate expertise.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe project follows a structured PR process with:\n\n1. **Discussion-first approach**: Contributors must open a discussion and get approval before creating a PR\n2. **Structured workflow**:\n   - Fork the repository\n   - Create a new branch for changes\n   - Make changes\n   - Create a PR to the 'stage' branch (not directly to main)\n   - Wait for maintainer approval\n\n3. **Content guidelines for educational materials**:\n   - Specific formatting requirements for course content\n   - Directory structure requirements\n   - Guidelines for including images and other media\n   - Requirements for notebook creation\n\n4. **Stage-based release workflow**: Contributions are collected in the 'stage' branch and published in regular intervals\n\nThis approach ensures quality and consistency in the educational content while maintaining an organized development process.",
