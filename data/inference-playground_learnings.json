    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a web application built with modern JavaScript technologies, focusing on Svelte as the primary framework. The project likely involves some machine learning inference capabilities based on component names, though specific ML frameworks aren't identified.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** are the primary languages\n- Evidenced by configuration files like `tsconfig.json`, `vite.config.ts`, and TypeScript definition files (`.d.ts`)\n- JavaScript is used alongside TypeScript\n\n## Frontend Frameworks\n\n- **Svelte** is the primary frontend framework\n- **SvelteKit** is used for the application structure\n- Demonstrated by `svelte.config.js` and numerous `.svelte` files\n- Follows SvelteKit conventions with files like `+layout.svelte` and `+page.svelte`\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n- **Node.js** serves as the runtime environment\n- **SvelteKit** is used for backend functionality\n- API routes are defined in the SvelteKit structure (`src/routes/api/`)\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\n- **REST** architecture is used for API endpoints\n- Evidenced by the structure of API routes in `src/routes/api/` with `+server.ts` files\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Docker** is used for containerization (presence of `Dockerfile`)\n- **GitHub Spaces** appears to be the deployment target\n- Deployment is managed through GitHub workflow (`deploy-to-spaces.yml`)\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **Vitest** for unit testing (`vitest-setup-client.ts`)\n- **Playwright** for end-to-end testing (`playwright.config.ts`, `e2e/home.test.ts`)\n- Various test files with `.test.ts` and `.spec.ts` extensions\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Vite** is used as the build tool\n- Configured through `vite.config.ts`\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **pnpm** is the chosen package manager\n- Evidenced by `pnpm-lock.yaml` and `.npmrc` files\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions** for continuous integration and deployment\n- Multiple workflow files in `.github/workflows/` directory:\n  - `test.yml`\n  - `deploy-to-spaces.yml`\n  - `lint.yml`\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git** is used for version control\n- Standard Git configuration with `.git/config` and `.gitignore`\n\nThe project appears to be a modern web application with a well-structured testing strategy and automated deployment pipeline. The use of SvelteKit for both frontend and backend suggests a focus on developer experience and code reuse across the stack.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working style based on the repository analysis. The team appears to follow modern web development practices with a focus on code organization and quality assurance through automated tooling.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a feature-based organization structure with a dedicated library directory for shared code. This approach demonstrates a clear separation of concerns in the codebase:\n\n- **src/lib directory**: Contains shared code organized by functionality:\n  - `components/`: Reusable UI components\n  - `utils/`: Utility functions and helpers\n  - `state/`: State management logic\n  - `spells/`: Specialized functionality (likely domain-specific)\n- **src/routes**: Follows SvelteKit's file-based routing convention\n\nThis organization pattern suggests the team values modularity and reusability, making it easier to maintain and extend the codebase as it grows.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team enforces consistent code style through automated tooling:\n\n- **Prettier** for code formatting (`.prettierrc.mjs`, `.prettierignore`)\n- **ESLint** for linting (`eslint.config.mts`)\n- Custom ESLint rules (`eslint-rules/enforce-extensions.js`)\n- Automated linting through CI/CD (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`)\n\nThis comprehensive approach to code style enforcement indicates the team places high value on code consistency and quality, using automation to reduce manual review burden for style-related issues.\n\nThe presence of custom ESLint rules suggests the team has identified specific coding patterns they want to enforce across the codebase.",

This could indicate one of the following:\n\n1. The repository does not contain explicit documentation of non-functional requirements\n2. The specific requirements may be defined elsewhere (e.g., in external documentation not included in the repository)\n3. The project may be in an early stage where non-functional specifications have not yet been formalized\n\nWithout additional information, I cannot provide a detailed summary of non-functional specifications for this repository.\n\nIf you would like to explore specific aspects of the codebase to infer potential non-functional characteristics, or if you have additional context to share about the repository, I would be happy to assist further.",
