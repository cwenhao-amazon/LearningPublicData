    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a data processing pipeline focused on Common Crawl data, likely for natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The project primarily uses Python for scripting and data processing, with some specialized tools for language modeling.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the primary programming language used throughout the project. The codebase includes multiple Python scripts in both the pipeline_scripts and analysis_scripts directories, handling tasks such as:\n\n- Processing Common Crawl data\n- Filtering and deduplicating content\n- Removing specific URLs (like Wikipedia)\n- Performing text analysis and term counting\n\n## Package Management\n\nThe project uses **pip** for Python package management, as evidenced by the presence of a requirements.txt file. This standard approach allows for easy dependency installation and environment replication.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n**KenLM** is utilized as a language modeling toolkit in this project. KenLM is a specialized library for statistical language modeling, commonly used in NLP tasks. The repository includes:\n\n- A model.py file in the KenLM directory\n- A README.md with KenLM-specific documentation\n- An add_perplexity.py script that likely uses KenLM to calculate perplexity scores for text data\n\nThis suggests the project involves language modeling for text analysis or quality assessment of the crawled data.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as indicated by the presence of standard Git directories and configuration files (.git/index, .git/config, .gitmodules). The presence of .gitmodules suggests the project may include Git submodules, which are typically used to incorporate external repositories.",

    "summary": "\n\n# Team Preferences Summary\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team organizes code by functionality with separate directories for pipeline scripts, analysis scripts, and experimental features. This suggests a modular approach where code is separated based on its purpose and function.\n\nThe repository structure shows:\n- `pipeline_scripts/common_crawl/` - Contains scripts for data processing pipelines\n- `analysis_scripts/` - Contains scripts for data analysis\n- `pipeline_scripts/common_crawl/experimental/` - Contains features under development or testing\n\nThis organization indicates the team values separation of concerns and likely follows a modular design philosophy.\n\nWhile the repository contains sample Git hooks, they appear to be default Git samples rather than customized workflows, suggesting that formal version control workflows may not be explicitly defined or are maintained outside the repository structure.\n\nThe absence of explicit style guide files (like .pylintrc or .flake8) means that coding style guidelines, if they exist, are likely communicated through other channels or are implicit within the team's practices.\n\nNo information was available regarding:\n- Design Systems\n- Documentation Style and Standards\n- Architectural Patterns\n- Meeting Cadences\n- Communication Channels\n- Task Management\n- Onboarding Procedures\n- Release Management\n- Cross-team Collaboration\n- Code Review Standards\n- Testing Philosophy\n- Technical Debt Management\n- Knowledge Sharing\n- Working Hours and Availability\n- Team Roles and Responsibilities\n- PR Style Guidelines\n- Issue Style Guidelines\n- Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThis summary represents only what could be determined from the repository structure. The team may have additional preferences and practices that are not explicitly documented in the repository files.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be focused on processing Common Crawl data, which is a massive web crawl dataset. Based on the available information, there are limited explicit non-functional specifications documented in the codebase. However, we can identify some network requirements that are critical to the project's operation.\n\n## Network Requirements\n\nThe repository includes functionality for downloading and processing Common Crawl data, which has specific network-related considerations:\n\n- **Bandwidth requirements**: The system needs sufficient bandwidth to download potentially large Common Crawl WET/WAT files from the Common Crawl data repository (https://data.commoncrawl.org/crawl-data/)\n- **Parallel download capability**: The system uses the \"ungoliant\" tool with configurable parallel processing (via `--num_proc` parameter) to optimize download speed\n- **Configurable data transfer**: The implementation allows sampling of segments (using `--segment_sampling_ratios`) to reduce the amount of data transferred\n- **Multiple snapshot handling**: The system can work with multiple Common Crawl snapshots which could represent large datasets\n- **Temporary file management**: The download process includes management of temporary files during data transfer\n\nThese network requirements suggest that the system is designed to efficiently handle large-scale web data while providing configuration options to control bandwidth usage and processing resources.\n\n*Note: While the repository likely has additional non-functional requirements related to performance, scalability, and memory/CPU constraints given its focus on processing large Common Crawl datasets, specific details about these aspects were not explicitly documented in the examined files.*",
