    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be an Auth0 integration for Hugging Face authentication, providing a bridge between Auth0 identity management and Hugging Face's OAuth services.\n\n## Programming Languages\n- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used in the project\n- Used for both implementation code and test files\n- Found in integration directory with files like `fetchUserProfile.js`\n\n## Backend Technologies\n- **Node.js**: Server-side JavaScript runtime\n- Evidenced by CommonJS module exports syntax\n- Uses Node.js callback patterns (error-first callbacks)\n- Leverages request module for HTTP requests\n\n## API Design Patterns\n- **REST**: The project interacts with RESTful APIs\n- Makes HTTP GET requests to Hugging Face OAuth userinfo endpoint\n- Uses Authorization headers with Bearer tokens\n- Processes JSON responses from API endpoints\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n- **Auth0 Marketplace**: Designed to be deployed as an Auth0 integration\n- Configuration defined in `deploy/template.json`\n- Sets up OAuth2 integration strategy for Hugging Face\n- Includes display name and icon URL for marketplace listing\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n- **JavaScript testing framework** (likely Jest or Mocha)\n- Uses `.spec.js` naming convention for test files\n- Test files correspond to implementation files (e.g., `fetchUserProfile.spec.js`)\n\n## Build Systems\n- **Make**: Used as a build system or task runner\n- Evidenced by the presence of a `Makefile` in the root directory\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and delivery\n- Workflow files located in `.github/workflows/`\n- Separate workflows for linting (`lint.yaml`) and testing (`test.yaml`)\n\n## Version Control Systems\n- **Git**: Used for version control\n- Standard Git directory structure present\n- Includes `.gitignore` file for excluding files from version control",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the team based on the repository analysis. The team appears to follow structured development practices with an emphasis on automation, quality control, and clear contribution guidelines.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses Git for version control with sample hooks available in the repository:\n- Sample hooks include pre-commit, pre-push, and prepare-commit-msg\n- The pre-push hook contains logic to prevent pushing \"WIP\" (work in progress) commits\n- While these hooks are not actively enabled (they have the .sample extension), their presence suggests workflow conventions that could be activated\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team employs automated linting via GitHub Actions with a focus on integration testing:\n- Linting is executed using a Docker container (auth0/marketplace-integration-tools)\n- The project appears to be Node.js based\n- The workflow includes caching of node modules to improve CI performance\n- Integration-specific linting rules are applied\n- The structured approach to code quality includes automated enforcement\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team emphasizes automated testing as part of their development process:\n- Test files are present in the repository (e.g., integration/fetchUserProfile.spec.js)\n- A dedicated GitHub Actions workflow for testing (.github/workflows/test.yaml) is implemented\n- This indicates that testing is a valued component of their development lifecycle\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team follows Auth0 open source contribution standards:\n- Discussions about changes should occur by opening an issue before implementation\n- Contributors should search for existing issues/PRs to avoid duplication\n- A \"fork-and-pull\" Git workflow is followed\n- Descriptive branch names are required\n- PR templates are used for efficient reviews\n- Contributors should merge latest upstream changes before submitting PRs\n- Adherence to the project's Code of Conduct is expected\n- Support questions should be directed to community forums rather than issues\n- Specific procedures exist for security vulnerabilities\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe team implements a fork-and-pull workflow with PR templates:\n- Contributors must search existing PRs before creating new ones\n- The workflow involves forking the repository to your own GitHub account\n- Local cloning of the project is required\n- Branch names should be \"succinct but descriptive\"\n- Changes should be committed to the branch and pushed to the fork\n- PRs should be opened in the original repository (not the fork)\n- PR templates must be followed for efficient reviews\n- Latest upstream changes should be merged before submitting PRs\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses templated issue reporting with pre-submission checks:\n- Contributors must search existing issues before creating new ones\n- An issue template guides submitters through pre-submission checks\n- Issues should not be duplicates\n- Sufficient information for research and reproduction must be provided\n- Issues should not be used for general support questions (these should go to community forums)\n- A separate process exists for security vulnerabilities",
