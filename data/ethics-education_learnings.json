    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be primarily focused on educational content about AI ethics, with minimal technical implementation. Based on the available information, there are very few technical choices explicitly identified in the repository.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n- **Hugging Face**: The repository is associated with Hugging Face's ethics initiatives (referenced at hf.co/ethics). While there's no explicit code showing ML framework usage, Hugging Face is known for its transformers library and machine learning ecosystem, suggesting this educational material is related to their ML technologies.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: The repository uses Git for version control, as evidenced by the presence of a standard .git directory structure including config, HEAD, and index files.\n\nThe repository appears to be primarily documentation and educational material rather than an implementation project, which explains the limited technical stack information available. The content focuses on AI ethics rather than showcasing specific technologies or frameworks.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be an educational resource focused on AI ethics, with a straightforward organization that prioritizes content delivery over complex code structures. The repository is still in development, with some sections marked as \"coming soon.\"\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a simple and intuitive directory structure:\n\n- **Root directory**: Contains the main README and configuration files\n- **explainers/**: Houses notebooks and blog-style material explaining ethics concepts\n- **course/**: Reserved for structured educational material (marked as \"coming soon\")\n\nThis content-focused organization is appropriate for educational materials, making it easy for users to find either explanatory content or structured course materials.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses a standard Git workflow for version control. The repository includes the default Git hook sample files:\n\n- pre-commit.sample\n- pre-push.sample\n- prepare-commit-msg.sample\n- commit-msg.sample\n\nThese hooks remain in their default sample state (with the .sample extension) and don't appear to be customized or actively used, suggesting a relatively straightforward approach to version control without complex automated checks or enforced workflows.",

The non-functional requirements are documented elsewhere, not in the examined files\n2. The project may be in an early stage where non-functional requirements haven't been formally specified yet\n3. The project may have an implicit understanding of non-functional requirements that isn't documented\n\nFor a more complete understanding of the non-functional specifications, additional repository files would need to be examined, or project stakeholders would need to be consulted.",
