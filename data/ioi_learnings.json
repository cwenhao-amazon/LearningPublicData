    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary\n\nThis repository is primarily a Python-based project focused on evaluating language models on programming tasks, particularly for competitive programming problems like those from the International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). The system uses asynchronous programming patterns extensively and integrates with various machine learning APIs and frameworks.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the primary programming language used throughout the project. The codebase includes multiple Python files organized in directories like `generate` and `run_tests`, implementing functionality for model evaluation, test running, and scoring.\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\nThe backend is built with Python, leveraging several key libraries and frameworks:\n\n- **asyncio** for asynchronous programming\n- **aiohttp** for HTTP client functionality and API calls\n- **Hugging Face ecosystem** (datasets, transformers, huggingface_hub) for model loading and dataset management\n- **litellm** for LLM API abstraction\n- **polars** for data manipulation\n- **uvloop** for performance optimization of asyncio\n- Supporting libraries like tqdm, dotenv, and loguru for logging, progress tracking, and environment management\n\nThe architecture is designed around asynchronous processing to handle concurrent API calls efficiently.\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\nThe project implements a REST API client pattern, particularly in the `PistonClient` class, which:\n\n- Makes HTTP requests to REST endpoints (using methods like GET, POST, DELETE)\n- Handles JSON request/response payloads\n- Implements error handling and retries with exponential backoff and jitter\n- Uses asynchronous patterns with asyncio for non-blocking I/O\n- Implements load balancing across multiple endpoints\n- Includes health checks and endpoint management\n\nThis client is designed to communicate with the Piston API (a code execution service) using standard REST conventions.\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\nThe project uses **Slurm** for job scheduling and resource management, likely in a high-performance computing environment. This is evidenced by multiple `.slurm` files and scripts like `run_ioi_slurm.py` that interface with the Slurm workload manager.\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\nRather than using standard testing libraries, the repository implements a **custom testing framework** with:\n\n- Asyncio for asynchronous test execution\n- Test runners (TestsRunner class) for managing test execution\n- Scoring mechanisms for evaluating test outcomes\n- Dataclasses to represent test results\n- Caching mechanisms to avoid redundant test runs\n- Batched test execution with early termination on failure\n- Detailed test reporting and metrics\n\nThis framework is specifically designed for evaluating code submissions against competitive programming problems.\n\n## Package Management\n\n**pip** is used for Python package management, as evidenced by the presence of `requirements.txt` files in multiple directories.\n\n## Authentication/Security\n\nThe project uses **API key authentication** for accessing external services. This is implemented through environment variables stored in `.env` files, including:\n\n- OPENROUTER_API_KEY\n- OPENAI_API_KEY\n- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\n\nThese keys authenticate with various LLM providers. For the Piston execution environment, the code uses endpoint URLs configured through environment variables, with concurrency limits controlled by additional configuration.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe repository integrates several machine learning frameworks:\n\n- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For loading model configurations and accessing models\n- **LiteLLM**: As an abstraction layer for calling various LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)\n- **SGLang**: For model serving and inference\n- **Hugging Face Datasets**: For loading and managing datasets\n- **Polars**: For data manipulation and processing\n\nThe system is designed to evaluate language models on programming tasks, with functionality to load models, generate completions with specific parameters, process outputs, track token usage and costs, and handle model-specific configurations.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as indicated by the presence of a `.git` directory and `.gitignore` files.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the team based on the repository analysis. The team appears to follow standard software development practices with a focus on efficient testing and clear coding standards.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses Git for version control with standard Git hooks available but not actively implemented. The repository contains sample hook scripts that come with a default Git installation:\n\n- pre-push.sample: Prevents pushing commits with messages starting with \"WIP\"\n- pre-commit.sample: Verifies what's about to be committed and checks for non-ASCII filenames\n- prepare-commit-msg.sample: Prepares commit messages\n- commit-msg.sample: Checks commit messages for duplicate Signed-off-by lines\n\nThese hooks remain as samples (with .sample extension) and haven't been customized or activated, suggesting a relatively standard Git workflow without enforced commit policies.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows a comprehensive set of Python coding style guidelines:\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Snake_case for variables, functions, and modules: `get_context_length`, `test_case_run_cache`\n- CamelCase for classes: `IOIEvaluator`, `TestResult`, `SubtaskResult`\n- ALL_CAPS for constants\n- Descriptive names that indicate purpose: `context_length`, `num_retries`\n\n### Imports\n- Grouped in order: standard library, third-party library, local application\n- Specific imports rather than wildcard imports\n- `import` for modules and `from ... import` for specific functions/classes\n- Alphabetized within each group\n\n### Indentation and Whitespace\n- 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)\n- Blank lines to separate logical sections\n- Spaces around operators\n- No trailing whitespace\n- Maximum line length around 100-120 characters\n\n### Comments and Documentation\n- Docstrings for functions, classes, and modules\n- Formatted with summary line followed by detailed description\n- Parameter and return value descriptions in docstrings\n- Inline comments used sparingly for complex logic\n\n### Error Handling\n- Try/except blocks for error handling\n- Logging exceptions with appropriate severity levels\n- Fallback values when operations might fail\n\n### Function Design\n- Single-responsibility functions\n- Short and focused functions\n- Type hints for parameters and return values\n- Default values for optional parameters\n\n### Code Organization\n- Related functionality grouped into modules\n- Classes for complex functionality with state\n- Methods organized by visibility/importance\n\n### Asynchronous Programming\n- `async`/`await` for asynchronous operations\n- Asyncio primitives like semaphores for concurrency control\n- Proper locking for shared resources\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team employs an \"incremental testing with early termination and caching\" approach, which emphasizes efficiency and practical evaluation:\n\n### Key Testing Principles\n1. **Incremental Testing**: Tests run in batches with early termination if a test fails (scores 0.0)\n2. **Test Caching**: Avoids re-running tests that have already been executed\n3. **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Evaluates submissions against multiple test cases and subtasks\n4. **Status Classification**: Results classified into specific categories (CE, RE, WA, MLE, TLE, PA, AC)\n5. **Scoring System**: Uses a 0.0 to 1.0 scale with partial credit possible\n6. **Parallel Execution**: Tests executed in parallel using asyncio for maximum throughput\n7. **Isolation**: Tests run in isolated environments (using Piston) for security and consistency\n8. **Reproducibility**: Detailed results tracked and stored for analysis\n\nThis pragmatic testing approach is optimized for evaluating competitive programming submissions, where early detection of failures conserves computational resources.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\n## Overview\n\nThis project is designed for high-performance language model serving and evaluation in distributed computing environments. Key priorities include efficient GPU resource utilization, context length management for large language models, distributed computing capabilities through SLURM, and a resilient networking architecture.
