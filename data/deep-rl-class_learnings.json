    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be an educational course organized into units, with a structured approach to content management and community contributions. The team has established clear patterns for organizing educational content and managing feedback.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a modular structure organized by educational units:\n\n- Content is divided into distinct units (unit1 through unit8)\n- Each unit has its own directory containing:\n  - Jupyter notebooks for code examples and exercises\n  - MDX files for documentation and instructional content\n- Parallel directory structures exist:\n  - `notebooks/` directory containing executable code examples\n  - `units/en/` directory likely containing localized content (English)\n- Some units are further subdivided (e.g., unit8 has part1 and part2)\n\nThis organization reflects an educational focus with a clear progression through course materials, making it easy for learners to follow the curriculum sequentially.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses GitHub's built-in features to manage contributions:\n\n- Issue templates provide structure for community engagement\n- Focus appears to be on community contributions and feedback collection\n- No explicit information about internal branching strategies or merge policies\n\nThe workflow seems designed to facilitate educational content improvement through community feedback.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has implemented structured issue templates for different types of feedback:\n\n1. **Questions template** - For course-related questions\n   - Likely encourages checking Discord first for common questions\n   \n2. **Course improvement template** - For suggesting improvements or reporting errors\n   - Explicitly encourages Pull Requests for direct contributions\n   \n3. **Bug reporting template** - Specifically for issues with hands-on exercises\n   - Structured to collect relevant information for troubleshooting\n\nThese templates suggest a systematic approach to managing community feedback, with different channels for different types of contributions. The presence of these templates indicates the team values organized communication and wants to streamline the process of improving course materials.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided data, there are no explicit non-functional specifications identified in the repository. The repository appears to lack documentation or code that explicitly defines performance requirements, scalability expectations, security standards, maintainability goals, memory/CPU constraints, load testing parameters, caching strategies, logging requirements, audit trail requirements, or network requirements.\n\nThis absence of non-functional specifications suggests that the project may be in an early stage of development, or that these considerations have not been formally documented within the codebase. Alternatively, these specifications might be maintained in external documentation not included in the repository.\n\nFor a more complete understanding of the project's non-functional requirements, it would be advisable to:\n\n1. Check for any external documentation that might contain this information\n2. Consult with project stakeholders to understand implicit requirements\n3. Consider defining these specifications as the project matures\n\nWithout explicit non-functional specifications, the project may face challenges in ensuring consistent performance, security, and maintainability as it evolves.",
