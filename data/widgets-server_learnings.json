    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a TypeScript-based project focused on ISO language and country code handling, utilizing Node.js as its runtime environment. The project leverages GitHub's ecosystem for version control and continuous integration.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n**TypeScript** is the primary programming language used in this project. This is evidenced by numerous `.ts` files throughout the repository, including:\n- `utils.ts`\n- `Language.ts`\n- Various ISO standard implementation files:\n  - `iso/Iso3166.ts` (country codes)\n  - `iso/Iso639.ts` (language codes)\n  - `iso/Iso639-3166-mapping.ts` (mapping between language and country codes)\n  - `iso/iso-639-2.ts` and `iso/iso-639-3.ts` (specific ISO language code standards)\n  - `iso/Oscar.ts`\n  - `iso/Wikipedia.ts`\n\nTypeScript was likely chosen for its strong typing system, which would be particularly valuable for a project dealing with standardized codes and mappings.\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n**Node.js** serves as the runtime environment for this project. This is indicated by the presence of a Node.js workflow configuration file:\n- `.github/workflows/nodejs.yml`\n\nNode.js is a natural choice for TypeScript projects, providing a JavaScript runtime that works well with TypeScript's transpilation process.\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n**GitHub Actions** is used for automation within the project, as shown by:\n- `.github/workflows/nodejs.yml`\n\nThis workflow file likely handles tasks such as testing, building, and possibly deploying the project.\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n**GitHub Actions** serves as the CI/CD tool for this project, as evidenced by:\n- `.github/workflows/nodejs.yml`\n\nThe workflow file suggests automated processes are in place for continuous integration and possibly continuous deployment.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as indicated by:\n- The presence of a `.git/` directory\n- A `.gitignore` file for specifying intentionally untracked files\n\nGit is the industry standard for version control and integrates seamlessly with GitHub, which hosts this repository.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified working preferences and organizational approaches based on the repository analysis.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular organization approach based on functionality. ISO standards-related code is organized in a dedicated directory structure, with files clearly separated by their specific ISO standard focus:\n\n- `iso/Iso3166.ts`\n- `iso/Iso639-3166-mapping.ts`\n- `iso/Wikipedia.ts`\n- `iso/Iso639.ts`\n- `iso/iso-639-2.ts`\n- `iso/Oscar.ts`\n- `iso/iso-639-3.ts`\n\nThis organization demonstrates a clean separation of concerns, grouping related functionality together in a logical manner.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe repository uses a standard Git workflow without custom enforcement mechanisms. The presence of sample Git hooks indicates that the team is using a default Git installation:\n\n- Various sample hooks are present (`.git/hooks/*.sample`) including:\n  - pre-push\n  - pre-merge-commit\n  - pre-commit\n  - commit-msg\n  - and others\n\nSince these hooks remain as sample files (with the `.sample` extension), they are not active. This suggests the team relies on standard Git functionality without additional automated checks or validations during the version control process.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe team does not enforce any specific commit message convention. The repository only contains the default Git `commit-msg.sample` hook file which is not active. Without an active commit message hook or additional configuration files specifying commit message formats, the repository likely uses free-form commit messages without enforced conventions.\n\nThe sample hook only includes basic functionality for checking duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines, but since it's not enabled, even this minimal validation is not being performed.",

The analysis looked for information related to:\n\n- Performance requirements\n- Scalability expectations\n- Security standards\n- Maintainability goals\n- Memory/CPU constraints\n- Load testing parameters\n- Caching strategies\n- Logging requirements\n- Audit trail requirements\n- Network requirements\n\nNone of these specifications were documented in the repository files. This suggests that either:\n\n1. The non-functional requirements are documented elsewhere, outside of the repository\n2. The project may be in an early stage where non-functional requirements haven't been formally defined\n3. The project may have an implicit understanding of non-functional requirements that isn't captured in code comments or configuration files\n\nFor a more complete understanding of the project's non-functional specifications, it would be beneficial to consult project documentation, wiki pages, issue trackers, or speak directly with the development team.",
