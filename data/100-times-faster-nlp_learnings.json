    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and standards based on the repository analysis. The team appears to focus on high-performance Python code with particular attention to optimization techniques.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows a well-defined Python coding style that emphasizes readability, performance, and consistent formatting:\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- **Functions and variables**: Use `snake_case` (e.g., `check_rectangles_py`, `n_rectangles`)\n- **Classes**: Use `CamelCase` (e.g., `Rectangle`)\n- **Descriptive naming**: Names should clearly indicate purpose (e.g., `check_rectangles_py`, `main_rectangles_slow`)\n\n### Code Structure and Organization\n- Imports placed at the top of files\n- Related functions grouped together for better readability\n- Function names include descriptive prefixes (e.g., `check_`, `main_`) to indicate purpose\n- Functions follow single responsibility principle\n\n### Formatting\n- 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)\n- Consistent spacing around operators\n- Blank lines to separate logical sections of code\n- Line length kept reasonable (under ~80 characters)\n\n### Comments and Documentation\n- Markdown cells in notebooks for explanations\n- Descriptive headers with emoji for emphasis (e.g., `# \ud83d\ude80 100 Times Faster...`)\n- Clear documentation of setup requirements\n- Inline comments for complex operations\n\n### Performance Optimization\n- Cython used for performance-critical sections\n- Explicit type declarations in Cython with `cdef`\n- C-level data structures used when appropriate\n- Implementation benchmarking and comparison\n\n### Error Handling\n- Simple print statements for output\n- Timing information included for performance comparisons\n\nThe team's approach demonstrates a strong focus on performance optimization while maintaining readable and well-structured code. The use of both Python and Cython implementations for the same functionality suggests a methodical approach to performance improvement with empirical validation through benchmarking.",
