    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the repository.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular organization approach with clear separation of concerns. The codebase is structured in a hierarchical manner with dedicated directories for different components:\n\n- `optimum/exporters/executorch/tasks/` - Task-specific implementations\n- `optimum/exporters/executorch/recipes/` - Recipe implementations\n- `optimum/executorch/attentions/` - Attention mechanism implementations\n- `tests/models/` - Model-specific test suites\n\nThis organization demonstrates a logical grouping of functionality, making the codebase more maintainable and navigable.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository enforces consistent coding style through automated tools:\n\n- **Black formatter** (version ~=23.1) for consistent code style\n  - 88 character line length\n  - Double quotes for strings\n  - Consistent spacing and indentation\n- **Ruff linter** (version 0.4.4) for code quality checks\n  - Automated import sorting\n  - Removal of unnecessary whitespace\n\nThese tools enforce PEP 8 conventions with Black's opinionated formatting. The team has implemented automated style enforcement through CI/CD workflows that run on:\n- Pushes to main branch\n- Pushes to v*-release branches\n- Pull requests to main\n\nThe workflow sets up Python 3.9 and runs the formatting and linting checks, ensuring code quality standards are maintained across contributions.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team employs a comprehensive model testing approach. The repository contains numerous test files for different models:\n\n- `tests/models/test_modeling_mistral.py`\n- `tests/models/test_modeling_focalnet.py`\n- `tests/models/test_modeling_bert.py`\n- `tests/models/test_modeling_common.py`\n\nThe presence of a `test_modeling_common.py` file suggests that common testing patterns are abstracted for reuse across different model tests, promoting consistency and reducing duplication in test code.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\n## Overview\n\nThis repository focuses primarily on model optimization techniques for resource-constrained environments. The key non-functional priorities appear to be memory efficiency and performance optimization through quantization and caching strategies, particularly for transformer-based models.\n\n## Memory/CPU Constraints\n\nThe repository implements sophisticated model quantization techniques designed to reduce memory footprint and improve inference performance on resource-constrained devices. These techniques include:\n\n### Weight-only Quantization Options\n- **INT4 quantization** with per-group granularity (32)\n- **INT8 quantization** with per-axis granularity\n\n### Dynamic Activation Quantization\n- INT8 dynamic activation combined with INT4 weights (8da4w configuration)\n\n### Targeted Quantization Approaches\n- Selective quantization for embedding layers\n- Configurable quantization for linear layers\n\nThese quantization techniques provide flexibility in balancing model size reduction against accuracy preservation, allowing for deployment optimization based on specific hardware constraints.\n\n## Caching Strategies\n\nThe repository implements custom key-value (KV) caching for attention mechanisms in transformer models. This optimization technique:\n\n- Improves inference performance by storing previously computed key and value tensors\n- Reduces redundant computations during autoregressive generation\n- Is particularly valuable for sequence generation tasks where attention computations are a significant bottleneck\n\nThe custom implementation suggests tailored optimizations beyond standard caching approaches.",
