    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a TypeScript definition package for the Snapchat Lens API, providing type information for developers working with Snapchat's lens features.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **TypeScript**: The project uses TypeScript as evidenced by the presence of `.d.ts` definition files (specifically `snapchat-lens-api.d.ts`). These definition files provide type information for JavaScript code, enhancing developer experience with better tooling and type safety.\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\n- **Snapchat Lens API**: The repository is focused on providing TypeScript definitions for the Snapchat Lens API, which allows developers to interact with Snapchat's lens features. The `snapchat-lens-api.d.ts` file contains the type definitions for this API.\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **npm or yarn**: Standard JavaScript/TypeScript package management is used in this project, as evidenced by the presence of a `package.json` file. This file defines the package metadata and dependencies, though this particular package appears to have minimal dependencies as it's primarily a type definition package.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: The project uses Git for version control, as indicated by the presence of a `.git` directory containing standard Git files like `config`, `HEAD`, and `index`.\n\nThe repository appears to be a focused, specialized package providing TypeScript definitions for the Snapchat Lens API rather than a full application, which explains the absence of many typical application technologies like frontend frameworks, backend technologies, or database systems.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository represents a minimalist TypeScript declaration package for the Snapchat Lens API. The team appears to follow a streamlined approach focused on simplicity and standard conventions.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository follows a minimalist TypeScript declaration package style with these key guidelines:\n\n### Package Structure\n- Single TypeScript declaration file (.d.ts) as the main package content\n- Standard npm package.json with minimal configuration\n\n### Package Naming\n- Hyphenated lowercase package name (snapchat-lens-api)\n- Descriptive keywords for npm registry searchability\n\n### Versioning\n- Semantic versioning (x.y.z format)\n\n### Dependency Management\n- Minimal dependencies approach (empty dependencies and devDependencies)\n\n### Repository Organization\n- Simple structure with declaration file at root level\n- Standard GitHub repository configuration\n\nThe team appears to value simplicity and adherence to standard npm package conventions, maintaining a focused approach to providing TypeScript type declarations for the Snapchat Lens API.",

The analysis did not identify any documented performance requirements, scalability expectations, security standards, maintainability goals, or other non-functional aspects in the codebase.\n\nThis suggests that the project may benefit from defining and documenting these non-functional requirements to guide development efforts and set clear expectations for the system's operation.",
