    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a Node.js application focused on machine learning model inference, with both client-side and server-side components. The project is built primarily with TypeScript and leverages the Hugging Face ecosystem for various machine learning tasks.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n**TypeScript** is the primary programming language used in this project, as evidenced by:\n- Presence of `tsconfig.json` configuration file\n- Multiple `.ts` files throughout the source directory (`src/index.ts`, `src/types.ts`, `src/utils.ts`)\n- TypeScript is used for both client and server-side components\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n**Node.js** serves as the backend technology, indicated by:\n- `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files\n- Server-side components in the `src/nodes/server/` directory\n- Implementation of various server-side ML tasks like chat completion and text generation\n\n## Package Management\n\n**npm** is used for package management, as shown by:\n- `package.json` for dependency declarations\n- `package-lock.json` for dependency version locking\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n**Hugging Face** ecosystem is the primary machine learning framework, demonstrated by:\n- Authentication components (`src/nodes/server/hf-hub-login.ts`)\n- Various ML task implementations:\n  - Text generation (`src/nodes/server/text-generation.ts`)\n  - Image classification (`src/nodes/server/image-classification.ts`)\n  - Token classification (`src/nodes/server/token-classification.ts`)\n  - Chat completion (`src/nodes/server/chat-completion.ts`)\n  - Summarization (`src/nodes/server/summarization.ts`)\n\nThe project appears to provide interfaces for both client-side and server-side ML model inference across various domains including text, image, and object detection tasks.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as indicated by:\n- `.git/index` and `.git/config` files\n- `.gitignore` file for specifying intentionally untracked files",
