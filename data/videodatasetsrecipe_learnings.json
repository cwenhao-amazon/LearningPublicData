    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository represents a data processing project focused on building and uploading datasets to Hugging Face. The project primarily uses Python for data manipulation and leverages Hugging Face's ecosystem for machine learning dataset management.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the primary programming language used in this project, as evidenced by Python files such as `read_dataset.py` and `build_and_upload.py`. These scripts handle the core functionality of processing and uploading datasets.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nHugging Face Datasets is used as the specialized library for dataset handling. The code in `read_dataset.py` imports from the 'datasets' module, specifically using the `load_dataset` and `Video` components. This library is designed for working with machine learning datasets, particularly for natural language processing and computer vision tasks. While not a full machine learning framework like TensorFlow or PyTorch, it's a specialized library for dataset handling within the machine learning ecosystem.\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\nHugging Face is used as the deployment platform for hosting and sharing datasets. The `build_and_upload.py` script contains an `upload_to_huggingface` function that uses the \"huggingface-cli\" command line tool with the \"upload-large-folder\" command to upload datasets to Hugging Face's platform. The function takes parameters for the dataset path and Hugging Face dataset name (in the format 'username/dataset-name'), indicating that the project leverages Hugging Face's infrastructure for dataset distribution.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\nGit is used for version control, as indicated by the presence of a `.git` directory containing standard Git files like config, HEAD, and index.",

However, these are default templates that come with Git installations and have not been customized or activated, so we cannot determine the specific version control workflows the team follows.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository includes a standard Git commit message hook sample (`.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample`), but this is the default template that comes with Git installations. It has not been activated (it still has the .sample extension) and only contains code to check for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines. There is no evidence of a custom commit message convention being enforced through this hook or documented elsewhere in the repository.",
