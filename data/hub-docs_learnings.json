    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working practices based on the repository analysis. The team appears to have established structured processes for version control, issue management, and commit organization.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team employs a Pull Request based workflow with integrated discussions. This approach facilitates:\n\n- Collaborative code review through pull requests\n- Team discussions within the PR context\n- Structured approach to code integration\n\nThis workflow is documented in `docs/hub/repositories-pull-requests-discussions.md`, suggesting the team values clear documentation of their version control processes.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has implemented a highly structured approach to issue reporting through specialized templates:\n\n- Bug reports (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bugs.md`)\n- Feature requests (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`) \n- Documentation requests (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/documentation-request.md`)\n\nThis structured approach helps ensure that issues are reported with consistent information, making them easier to triage, prioritize, and address. The specialized templates indicate the team values organization and clarity in their issue tracking process.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository includes a `.git-blame-ignore-revs` file, which indicates:\n\n- The team has established practices around git blame functionality\n- Certain commits (likely formatting changes or automated modifications) are excluded from blame analysis\n- There is attention to maintaining a clean and meaningful commit history\n\nThis practice suggests the team values the ability to track meaningful code changes while filtering out noise from automated or bulk formatting changes.",
