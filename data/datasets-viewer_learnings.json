    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a relatively simple Python-based project with minimal infrastructure. Based on the available information, here's a summary of the technology choices identified.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n**Python** is the primary programming language used in this project, as evidenced by the presence of `run.py` and `requirements.txt` files. Python is widely used for data processing, web applications, and scripting tasks.\n\n## Package Management\n\n**pip** is used for package management, which is the standard package manager for Python projects. This is indicated by the presence of a `requirements.txt` file, which typically lists all the Python dependencies required by the project.\n\nThe requirements file includes:\n- datasets (likely for data loading)\n- streamlit (for web app development)\n- pandas (for data manipulation)\n- pyyaml (for YAML file processing)\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as shown by the presence of the `.git` directory and `.gitignore` file. Git is the most widely used version control system that allows developers to track changes, collaborate, and maintain different versions of their codebase.\n\n---\n\nNote: The repository appears to be a relatively simple Python project, possibly a data-focused web application using Streamlit. While there are indications of data manipulation capabilities through pandas, there's insufficient evidence to determine if any specific machine learning frameworks are being used, despite the presence of the \"datasets\" package which could potentially be related to Hugging Face's datasets library.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nBased on the repository analysis, there is limited explicit information about the team's preferences and working style. The repository appears to use standard Git configurations without customized workflows or guidelines.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe repository uses Git for version control with standard configurations:\n- Standard Git hooks are present (pre-push.sample, pre-commit.sample)\n- Uses conventional branch naming (master branch)\n- Has remote repository configuration (origin)\n\nHowever, there are no customized Git hooks or specialized version control workflows evident in the repository structure.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository contains standard Git commit message hook samples:\n- commit-msg.sample\n- prepare-commit-msg.sample\n\nThese are default Git templates rather than customized hooks, suggesting the team hasn't implemented specific commit message formatting requirements or automated validation.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided data, there are no explicitly defined non-functional specifications in the repository. The analysis did not identify any documented requirements for:\n\n- Performance requirements\n- Scalability expectations\n- Security standards\n- Maintainability goals\n- Memory/CPU constraints\n- Load testing parameters\n- Caching strategies\n- Logging requirements\n- Audit trail requirements\n- Network requirements\n\nThis suggests that the project may:\n- Be in early development stages where non-functional requirements haven't been formalized\n- Have these specifications documented outside the repository\n- Be following implicit standards not captured in the code or documentation\n- Need further development of non-functional specifications to ensure quality attributes are properly addressed\n\nIt would be beneficial for the project to document these non-functional requirements to guide development efforts and ensure the system meets expected quality attributes.",
