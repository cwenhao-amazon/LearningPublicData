    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository is primarily a Python-based machine learning project that uses PyTorch as its core ML framework. The project follows standard Python development practices with setuptools for building, pip for package management, and pytest for testing.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython serves as the primary programming language for this project. The codebase consists mainly of Python files (.py extension), including:\n- `setup.py` for package configuration\n- Various Python modules in the src directory structure (e.g., `src/controlnet_aux/util.py`, `src/controlnet_aux/processor.py`)\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nPyTorch is the chosen machine learning framework, as evidenced by:\n- Files with \"torch\" in their names (e.g., `src/controlnet_aux/leres/leres/Resnext_torch.py`)\n- Directories containing PyTorch-specific implementations like `activations_jit.py`\n\nPyTorch is likely used for its dynamic computational graph capabilities and widespread adoption in research-oriented machine learning projects.\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\npytest is used as the testing framework, demonstrated by:\n- Test files following pytest naming conventions (`test_processor_pytest.py`)\n- Testing requirements specified in `src/controlnet_aux/tests/requirements.txt`\n\n## Build Systems\n\nsetuptools is employed for building and packaging the Python project, as shown by:\n- The presence of `setup.py` in the root directory\n- This allows for proper distribution and installation of the package\n\n## Package Management\n\npip is used for package management, indicated by:\n- Requirements files (`src/controlnet_aux/tests/requirements.txt`) that specify dependencies\n- This follows standard Python project practices for dependency management\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\nGit is used for version control, as evidenced by:\n- The presence of a `.git` directory\n- A `.gitignore` file for specifying intentionally untracked files",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working style based on the repository analysis. The information is limited, but provides some insights into how the team organizes their codebase.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a **module-based organization with clear separation of components**. This is evident from the structure of files like:\n- src/controlnet_aux/__init__.py\n- src/controlnet_aux/processor.py\n- src/controlnet_aux/util.py\n\nThe codebase follows a hierarchical structure where:\n- Each model or processor has its own dedicated directory with specific modules\n- Common utilities are separated into util.py files\n- The organization promotes clear boundaries between different components\n\nThis approach suggests the team values modularity and separation of concerns in their code architecture, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.\n\n*Note: The repository analysis did not yield sufficient information about other team preferences such as version control workflows, coding style guidelines, code review standards, testing philosophy, PR style guidelines, issue style guidelines, or commit message conventions.*",
