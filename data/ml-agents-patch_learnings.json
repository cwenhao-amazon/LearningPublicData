    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the ML-Agents team based on repository analysis. The team employs a structured, quality-focused development process with comprehensive tooling for code quality and standardized workflows.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe ML-Agents repository follows a component-based organization with separate packages for different functionalities:\n\n- `ml-agents/` - Core Python API\n- `ml-agents-envs/` - Environment interfaces\n- `ml-agents-plugin-examples/` - Plugin examples\n- `com.unity.ml-agents/` - Unity package\n- `com.unity.ml-agents.extensions/` - Extensions\n\nThis modular approach allows for clear separation of concerns and better maintainability across the codebase.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses a pull request-based workflow with a structured PR template that includes:\n\n- Detailed change descriptions\n- Links to related issues/tickets\n- Categorization of change types (bug fix, feature, refactor, etc.)\n- Quality assurance checklist\n\nThis approach ensures changes are properly documented and reviewed against specific criteria before merging, maintaining code quality and documentation standards.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository follows comprehensive coding style guidelines enforced through pre-commit hooks and configuration files:\n\n### Python Style\n- Black formatter with 88 character line length for code\n- 120 character line length for comments/docstrings\n- MyPy for type checking with specific configurations\n- Flake8 for linting with custom rules\n- PyUpgrade to ensure modern Python syntax\n\n### C# Style\n- Uses dotnet-format for whitespace formatting\n- 4-space indentation\n\n### General Formatting\n- UTF-8 encoding without BOM\n- LF line endings\n- Trailing whitespace removal (except in Markdown)\n- 4-space indentation as default (2 spaces for JSON, Markdown)\n- Final newline insertion\n\n### Code Quality\n- Banned modules enforcement (e.g., direct TensorFlow/PyTorch imports)\n- Comprehensive test coverage (minimum 60%)\n- Various validation hooks for versioning and documentation\n\nThese detailed guidelines demonstrate the team's commitment to code consistency and quality.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe code review process is guided by the PR template that requires:\n\n1. **Change documentation**:\n   - Description of proposed changes\n   - Links to related issues, JIRA tickets, or forum threads\n   - Categorization of change types\n\n2. **Quality assurance checklist**:\n   - Test verification\n   - Documentation updates\n   - Changelog updates\n   - Migration guide updates\n\nThis standardized review framework ensures changes are properly documented, categorized, tested, and accompanied by necessary documentation updates.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team employs comprehensive unit and integration testing as evidenced by:\n\n- Extensive test directories for both Python (`ml-agents/mlagents/trainers/tests/`) and C# code (`com.unity.ml-agents/Tests/`)\n- Configuration for Python tests (`pytest.ini`)\n\nThis indicates a strong commitment to code quality through thorough testing.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses a standardized PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) that structures how changes are proposed and reviewed, ensuring consistency across contributions.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository includes standardized issue templates for:\n- Bug reports (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`)\n- Feature requests (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`)\n\nThese templates help ensure that issues are reported with consistent and complete information.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nThis document summarizes the identified non-functional specifications for the ML-Agents repository based on code analysis. The project appears to be a machine learning framework with specific considerations for performance optimization, resource utilization, and logging.\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\nThe repository demonstrates careful attention to performance optimization in its machine learning training components:\n\n- **Memory efficiency**\n  - Custom `AgentBuffer` implementation with specialized methods for batch processing\n  - Proper memory management for sequential vs. non-sequential data retrieval\n  - Specific handling for padding and truncation to optimize memory usage\n\n- **Batch processing capabilities**\n  - Support for configurable batch sizes and training lengths\n  - Mini-batch sampling for efficient training\n  - Handling of both LSTM (sequential) and non-LSTM processing patterns\n\n- **Data transformation efficiency**\n  - Efficient conversion between trajectory format and buffer format\n  - Handling of group observations with proper padding for missing data\n\nWhile no explicit performance benchmarks are documented, the test cases reveal a focus on memory-efficient operations and optimized data processing patterns critical for machine learning training performance.\n\n## Memory/CPU Constraints\n\nThe repository includes sophisticated CPU resource management that adapts to different execution environments:\n\n- **Thread allocation strategy**\n  - Default usage of half the available cores, capped at 4 threads\n  - Minimum of 1 thread guaranteed\n  - Implemented through the `get_num_threads_to_use()` function\n\n- **Container-aware resource detection**\n  - Intelligent detection of CPU limitations in containerized environments\n  - Reads cgroup information from `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_period_us` and `/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/cpu.cfs_quota_us`\n  - Special handling for Kubernetes environments by checking CPU shares (1024 shares per CPU)\n  - Fallback to `os.cpu_count()` when container information isn't available\n\nThis approach ensures appropriate resource utilization across different deployment scenarios, particularly in containerized environments where host CPU count may not reflect actual available resources.\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nThe repository implements a custom logging utility with the following characteristics:\n\n- **Log level configuration**\n  - Standard Python logging levels (CRITICAL, FATAL, ERROR, WARNING, INFO, DEBUG, NOTSET)\n  - Centralized control via `set_log_level()` function affecting all loggers\n  - Default level is NOTSET\n\n- **Formatting requirements**\n  - Two distinct formats based on log level:\n    - Debug format: `\"%(asctime)s %(levelname)s [%(filename)s:%(lineno)d] %(message)s\"`\n    - Standard format: `\"[%(levelname)s] %(message)s\"`\n  - Date format: `\"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S\"`\n\n- **Logger management**\n  - Centralized creation via `get_logger(name)` function\n  - All loggers tracked in a global `_loggers` set\n  - All loggers output to stdout\n\n- **Dynamic reconfiguration**\n  - Runtime adjustment of log level and format for all loggers\n  - Format automatically adjusts based on log level\n\nThis logging system ensures consistent behavior across the application with the ability to adjust verbosity globally. The design choice to direct all logs to stdout suggests integration with external log collection systems, typical in containerized environments.",
