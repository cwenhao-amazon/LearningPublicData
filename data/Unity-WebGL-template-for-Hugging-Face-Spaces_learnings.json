    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository is primarily a Unity-based project designed for WebGL deployment on Hugging Face's infrastructure. It leverages Unity's game development environment with C# scripting and JavaScript for web integration, packaged as a custom WebGL template for Hugging Face deployment.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **C#**: Primary programming language used for Unity development\n- **JavaScript**: Used in conjunction with the WebGL template for web deployment\n\n## Frontend Frameworks\n\n- **Unity WebGL**: The project utilizes Unity's WebGL export capabilities for rendering content in web browsers\n- Evidence includes the custom WebGL template package and related image assets\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Hugging Face**: The project is specifically designed to be deployed on Hugging Face's infrastructure\n- The custom Unity WebGL template is tailored for Hugging Face deployment, as indicated by the package name\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Unity**: Serves as the primary build system and development environment\n- The Unity package (.unitypackage) contains the necessary components for building the application\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Standard Git version control is used for the project\n- The repository contains the standard Git directory structure with config, HEAD, and index files",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a relatively new or minimally customized project, with limited evidence of established team practices. Based on the available information, we can identify only a few aspects of the team's working approach.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe repository uses a standard Git workflow with sample hooks included but not actively enabled. These sample hooks include:\n\n- **pre-push.sample**: Contains logic to prevent pushing commits with messages starting with \"WIP\"\n- **pre-commit.sample**: Checks for non-ASCII filenames and whitespace errors\n- **prepare-commit-msg.sample**: Includes examples for formatting commit messages\n- **commit-msg.sample**: Contains checks for duplicate signatures\n\nSince these hooks all retain their `.sample` extension, they are not currently active in the workflow, suggesting the team has not implemented automated enforcement of specific Git practices.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThere is no specific commit message convention being enforced in this repository. While sample Git hooks for commit messages exist (commit-msg.sample and prepare-commit-msg.sample), they remain inactive and only provide basic functionality:\n\n- The commit-msg.sample only checks for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines\n- The prepare-commit-msg.sample contains commented-out examples for removing help messages and adding signatures\n\nThe commit history shows only an initial clone from a Hugging Face repository, with no evidence of a standardized commit message format being followed.",

The repository does not contain clear documentation or code that specifies performance requirements, security standards, maintainability goals, or other non-functional aspects of the system.\n\nThis suggests that the repository may be in an early stage of development, or that non-functional requirements are not a primary focus of the project at this time.\n\nFor a comprehensive non-functional specification, the following aspects would typically be considered:\n\n- Performance requirements\n- Scalability expectations\n- Security standards\n- Maintainability goals\n- Memory/CPU constraints\n- Load testing parameters\n- Caching strategies\n- Logging requirements\n- Audit trail requirements\n- Network requirements\n\nWithout specific information about these aspects, it's not possible to provide a detailed summary of the non-functional specifications for this repository.",
