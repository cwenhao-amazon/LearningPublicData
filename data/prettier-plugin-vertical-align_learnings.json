    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a project focused on development tools, particularly involving a Prettier plugin for vertical alignment. Below is a summary of the key technologies identified in the codebase.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **TypeScript** and **JavaScript** are the primary programming languages used in this project\n- TypeScript configuration is present at the root level (tsconfig.json)\n- The codebase contains both `.ts` files (TypeScript) and `.js` files (JavaScript)\n- Key files include:\n  - `packages/prettier-plugin-vertical-align/src/printer.ts`\n  - `packages/test/src/index.ts`\n  - `packages/test/src/test.js`\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **pnpm** is used as the package manager\n- The project is structured as a monorepo using pnpm workspaces\n- Evidence includes:\n  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml` - defines the workspace configuration\n  - `pnpm-lock.yaml` - dependency lock file\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **GitHub Actions** is used for automation workflows\n- Configured in `.github/workflows/test.yml`\n- Likely used for running tests and other CI processes\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions** serves as the CI/CD solution\n- The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/test.yml`\n- This enables automated testing and potentially deployment processes\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git** is used for version control\n- Standard Git configuration is present:\n  - `.git/config`\n  - `.gitignore` for excluding files from version control\n\nThe project appears to be a developer tooling project with a focus on code formatting (given the presence of a Prettier plugin). It follows modern JavaScript development practices with TypeScript for type safety, a monorepo structure managed by pnpm, and automated workflows through GitHub Actions.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key preferences and working style identified in the repository, focusing on how the team organizes and maintains their codebase.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team uses a monorepo structure with workspace packages managed through pnpm. The repository contains multiple packages organized under a common `packages` directory, including:\n\n- `test`\n- `prettier-plugin-vertical-align`\n- `test-groups`\n\nThis approach allows the team to maintain related projects in a single repository while keeping them modularly separated, facilitating shared dependencies and coordinated versioning across packages.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nCode formatting is standardized using Prettier throughout the project. This is evidenced by:\n\n- `.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore` files at the root level\n- Package-specific Prettier configuration files in each workspace package\n\nNotably, the team is developing their own custom Prettier plugin (`prettier-plugin-vertical-align`), which demonstrates a significant commitment to code formatting standards and suggests they have specific formatting needs beyond what standard Prettier provides.\n\nThe use of consistent formatting tools across all packages indicates the team values code readability and maintainability, with automated formatting to reduce style-related discussions during code reviews.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided data, there are no explicitly defined non-functional specifications in the repository. The analysis did not identify any documented requirements for:\n\n- Performance requirements\n- Scalability expectations\n- Security standards\n- Maintainability goals\n- Memory/CPU constraints\n- Load testing parameters\n- Caching strategies\n- Logging requirements\n- Audit trail requirements\n- Network requirements\n\nThis suggests that the repository may:\n\n1. Be in early development stages where non-functional requirements haven't been formalized\n2. Have these specifications documented elsewhere (outside the repository)\n3. Be focused primarily on functional requirements with non-functional aspects being addressed implicitly\n\nFor a more comprehensive understanding of the project's non-functional specifications, it would be beneficial to:\n\n- Review any external documentation\n- Consult with project stakeholders\n- Examine deployment configurations that might contain implicit non-functional parameters\n- Check for any testing frameworks that might enforce certain non-functional criteria",
