    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a specialized library called \"diff2html\" that renders code diffs in HTML format. It's primarily a frontend utility with no backend components, focusing on providing a clean way to visualize code differences.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **TypeScript** is the primary language used throughout the project\n- **JavaScript** is also present in some files\n- Evidence found in `tsconfig.json`, `src/diff2html.ts`, and various UI component files\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **Jest** is used for testing\n- Configured via `jest.config.js`\n- Tests are organized in the `src/__tests__/` directory with files like `diff-parser-tests.ts` and `line-by-line-tests.ts`\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Webpack** handles the build process\n- Custom webpack configurations are defined in `webpack.bundles.ts` and `webpack.website.ts`\n- Used to bundle the library for distribution\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **Yarn** is the preferred package manager\n- Evidenced by the presence of both `yarn.lock` and `package.json` files\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **CircleCI** is configured for continuous integration/deployment\n- **GitHub Actions** is also used, specifically for CodeQL security analysis\n- Configuration files: `.circleci/config.yml` and `.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Terraform** is used for infrastructure management\n- Infrastructure as code is defined in `terraform/main.tf`, `terraform/variables.tf`, and `terraform/outputs.tf`\n- **CircleCI** likely handles the deployment process\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git** is used for version control\n- Standard Git configuration with `.gitignore` for excluding files from version control\n\nThe project is notable for being a focused, specialized library rather than a full application. It doesn't rely on major frontend frameworks, instead implementing its own UI components tailored specifically for diff visualization.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the established team preferences and working practices for this repository, based on the available documentation and code structure.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe project maintains strict code quality standards through automated tooling:\n\n- **Formatting tools**: Uses Prettier for consistent code formatting, with specific rules defined in `.prettierrc.json`\n- **Linting**: Employs ESLint for code quality and style enforcement via `.eslintrc.js`\n- **Editor consistency**: Implements `.editorconfig` to ensure consistent coding styles across different editors and IDEs\n\nThese tools work together to maintain code quality and consistency across the codebase, reducing style-related discussions during code reviews.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team follows a checklist-based approach to code reviews with strong emphasis on automated quality checks:\n\n- **Pre-submission requirements**:\n  - Running tests locally with `yarn test`\n  - Ensuring code passes linting with `yarn run lint`\n- **Automated verification**:\n  - CircleCI builds must pass\n  - Codacy quality checks must pass\n- **Approval process**: Clear thresholds based on passing automated checks\n\nThis approach ensures consistent quality standards while minimizing subjective aspects of code reviews.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nPull requests follow specific guidelines to maintain repository quality:\n\n- **Process requirements**:\n  - Create an issue before proposing new features\n  - Test code thoroughly before submitting PRs\n  - Use git rebase (not merge) to sync with master\n- **Quality gates**: All CI builds must pass\n- **Exclusions**: Do not commit \"dist\" or \"build\" folders in PRs\n\nThese guidelines help maintain a clean repository history and ensure all contributions meet quality standards.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe project uses structured issue reporting to ensure consistent information gathering:\n\n- **Templated approach**: Dedicated templates for bug reports and feature requests\n- **Location**: Templates stored in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` directory\n- **Purpose**: Ensures all necessary information is provided upfront\n\nThis structured approach helps maintainers triage and address issues more efficiently.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows a structured commit message format:\n\n- **First line format**:\n  - Maximum 50 characters\n  - Includes subsystem prefix (e.g., \"net: add localAddress and localPort to Socket\")\n- **Structure**:\n  - First line: concise summary with subsystem prefix\n  - Second line: must be blank\n  - Remaining lines: detailed description wrapped at 72 columns\n- **Purpose**: Creates a readable and consistent commit history that's easy to navigate and understand\n\nThis structured approach makes the repository history more navigable and helps with automated changelog generation.",
