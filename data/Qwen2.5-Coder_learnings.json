    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach identified in the repository, highlighting key aspects of the team's development practices and preferences.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a modular organization with clear separation of concerns between different functional areas:\n\n- **Evaluation code**: Located in `qwencoder-eval` directory with subdirectories for different evaluation types:\n  - `instruct/` - Instruction-based evaluations\n  - `reasoning/` - Reasoning-based evaluations\n  - `base/` - Base evaluation code\n\n- **Training code**: Located in `finetuning` directory with specialized subdirectories:\n  - `sft/` - Supervised fine-tuning\n  - `dpo/` - Direct preference optimization\n\n- **Example code**: Located in `examples/` directory\n\nThis organization demonstrates the team's preference for clear boundaries between different functional components, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team follows a **GitHub Flow** workflow with branch-based development and pull requests. This is evidenced by the presence of GitHub Actions workflows:\n\n- Branch management workflows\n- Continuous Integration (CI) workflows\n- Automated testing workflows\n\nThese workflows suggest a structured approach to version control with automated processes for quality assurance.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has established comprehensive coding style guidelines, particularly for Go development:\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- CamelCase for types, variables, functions, and constants\n- Descriptive names that reflect purpose\n- Consistent capitalization for acronyms (e.g., `ID`, `JSON`, `HTTP`)\n- Lowercase, single-word identifiers for package names\n- Interface names often end with \"-er\" (e.g., `Language`)\n\n### Code Structure\n- Related functions are grouped together\n- Interfaces are explicitly implemented with `var _ InterfaceName = (*ConcreteType)(nil)` pattern\n- `init()` functions are used for package initialization and registration\n- Functions focus on single responsibilities\n- Imports are organized in groups: standard library, third-party, local packages\n\n### Error Handling\n- The `pkg/errors` package is used for error wrapping\n- Errors are always checked and handled appropriately\n- Errors are returned with context using `pkgerrors.WithStack()`, `pkgerrors.WithMessage()`, or `pkgerrors.Wrap()`\n- Error messages are descriptive and include context\n\n### Comments and Documentation\n- Comments are added for exported functions, types, and constants\n- Complete sentences with proper punctuation are used\n- Function parameters and return values are documented\n- Examples are included where appropriate\n\n### Formatting\n- Standard Go formatting is followed (using `gofmt` or `gopls`)\n- Tabs are used for indentation\n- Line length is kept reasonable\n- Blank lines separate logical sections\n\n### Testing\n- Test files are named with `_test.go` suffix\n- Test functions are named `TestXxx` where `Xxx` is the function being tested\n- Table-driven tests are used where appropriate\n\n### Error Handling Patterns\n- Success returns `(result, nil)`, failure returns `(zero-value, error)`\n- Multiple return values are used for errors rather than sentinel values\n- Errors are wrapped to add context when returning up the call stack\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team embraces a **comprehensive testing approach** with both unit tests and integration tests across multiple languages:\n\n- **Unit tests** for individual components:\n  - Language-specific tests (Go, Java, Ruby)\n  - Python component tests\n\n- **Integration tests** for end-to-end functionality:\n  - Task integration tests\n\nThis multi-language testing strategy indicates a strong commitment to quality assurance regardless of the implementation language, ensuring that all components work correctly both individually and together.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has established a **roadmap template** for issues, which standardizes how roadmap-related issues should be formatted. This template helps maintain consistency in issue tracking and planning, particularly for features on the development roadmap.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nThis document summarizes the identified non-functional specifications for the repository, which appears to be focused on language model evaluation and training.\n\n## Scalability Expectations\n\nThe repository demonstrates clear expectations for scalability through its infrastructure and configuration:\n\n- Support for distributed training across multiple nodes using DeepSpeed\n- Multiple ZeRO optimization levels (1, 2, and 3) to accommodate different scaling needs\n- Kubernetes configuration for distributed evaluation infrastructure\n- Design that supports evaluation across multiple models and languages simultaneously\n\nThe presence of DeepSpeed configuration files with different ZeRO optimization levels (`ds_config_zero1.json`, `ds_config_zero2.json`, `ds_config_zero3.json`) indicates a sophisticated approach to distributed training that can scale according to available resources and performance requirements.\n\n## Maintainability Goals\n\nThe repository exhibits strong maintainability goals through:\n\n- **Modular design with clear separation of concerns**:\n  - Distinct directories for different functional areas (`qwencoder-eval/instruct/`, `qwencoder-eval/reasoning/`, `qwencoder-eval/base/`)\n  - Separate modules for different training approaches (`finetuning/sft/`, `finetuning/dpo/`)\n  - Examples directory for reference implementations\n\n- **Comprehensive testing**:\n  - Tests across multiple programming languages (e.g., Go: `language_test.go`)\n  - Functional testing of core components (e.g., `test_sendchat.py`)\n  - Consistent organization of test files within their respective modules\n\nThis structure suggests a deliberate focus on long-term maintainability, making it easier for developers to understand, modify, and extend the codebase.\n\n## Caching Strategies\n\nThe repository implements evaluation result caching as evidenced by:\n\n- Dedicated cache directories for evaluation results (`eval_cache/evalplus/`)\n- Cached benchmark datasets (`HumanEvalPlus-v0.1.9.jsonl`, `MbppPlus-v0.1.0.jsonl`)\n\nThis caching strategy is particularly important for language model evaluation, where:\n1. Evaluations can be computationally expensive\n2. Results may need to be referenced multiple times\n3. Reproducibility of results is critical for scientific validity\n\nBy caching evaluation results, the system can avoid redundant computation and ensure consistent benchmarking across different runs.",
