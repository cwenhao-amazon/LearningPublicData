    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary\n\nThis repository represents a machine learning inference service with a focus on text embeddings and model serving. The project is built with a multi-language approach, emphasizing performance and scalability.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nThe codebase uses a combination of three primary languages:\n\n- **Rust**: The core language used for the router and performance-critical components\n- **Python**: Used for backend server implementations, particularly for text embedding services\n- **JavaScript**: Employed for load testing the services\n\nRust appears to be the strategic choice for the main application components, likely chosen for its performance characteristics and memory safety.\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\nThe service architecture leverages several backend technologies:\n\n- **gRPC**: Used for high-performance RPC communication between components\n- **HTTP server**: Provides REST API endpoints for service access\n- **ONNX Runtime**: Enables cross-platform, high-performance inference for machine learning models\n- **Candle**: A Rust-based machine learning framework used for model execution\n\nThis combination allows for flexible deployment options while maintaining high performance for model inference.\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\nThe service implements dual API approaches:\n\n- **gRPC**: Using Protocol Buffers (`.proto` files) for service definitions, enabling efficient binary communication\n- **REST**: HTTP-based API endpoints for broader compatibility\n\nThis dual approach provides flexibility for different client integration needs.\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\nDeployment is supported through containerization and cloud services:\n\n- **Docker**: Multiple Dockerfiles for different environments:\n  - Standard Docker environment\n  - CUDA-enabled containers for GPU acceleration\n  - HPU-specific containers\n- **AWS SageMaker**: Integration with Amazon's machine learning deployment service\n\nThe variety of Docker configurations suggests a focus on deployment flexibility across different hardware environments.\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **Rust test framework**: The project uses Rust's built-in testing capabilities\n- Tests include snapshot testing for verification of expected outputs\n\n## Build Systems\n\nThe project employs two build systems:\n\n- **Cargo**: Rust's native package manager and build system\n- **Make**: Used for build automation and cross-language build orchestration\n\n## Package Management\n\nDependencies are managed through:\n\n- **Cargo**: For Rust dependencies, as evidenced by Cargo.toml and Cargo.lock files\n- **Poetry**: For Python dependencies, using modern Python dependency management\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and deployment workflows\n- Includes security scanning (TruffleHog) and Docker image building/publishing\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe project integrates with several ML frameworks:\n\n- **Hugging Face models**: Compatible with popular pre-trained models\n- **ONNX Runtime**: For cross-platform model inference\n- **Candle**: A Rust ML framework for efficient model execution\n\nThe repository implements various model architectures including BERT and Mistral.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Standard version control system used for the project",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the team based on repository analysis. The team demonstrates a structured, well-organized development process with clear guidelines for contributions and code quality.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular organization approach with clear separation of concerns. This is evident in how the codebase is structured:\n\n- Router functionality is separated from backends\n- Within components, further modularization exists (e.g., HTTP vs. gRPC servers)\n- Model implementations are organized in dedicated modules\n\nFiles demonstrating this approach include:\n- `router/src/lib.rs`\n- `router/src/http/mod.rs`\n- `router/src/grpc/mod.rs`\n- `backends/candle/src/models/mod.rs`\n\nThis organization enhances maintainability and allows team members to work on different components with minimal interference.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team follows GitHub Flow with structured templates for contributions. This approach includes:\n\n- Pull request templates\n- Specialized issue templates for different purposes\n\nKey files supporting this workflow:\n- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml`\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.yml`\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/new-model-addition.yml`\n\nThis structured approach ensures consistency in how changes are proposed and reviewed.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team enforces Rust formatting and linting standards through automated tools:\n\n- Pre-commit hooks for consistent code formatting\n- Specific Rust toolchain version requirements\n- Custom Cargo configuration\n\nSupporting files:\n- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`\n- `rust-toolchain.toml`\n- `.cargo/config.toml`\n\nThese tools help maintain code quality and consistency across the codebase.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team implements a thorough code review process with:\n\n- A checklist approach to ensure all requirements are met\n- Community-based reviews where anyone can participate\n- Specific documentation requirements\n- Process for tagging relevant reviewers\n- Follow-up procedures for PRs not reviewed within a week\n\nThe PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) outlines these standards in detail, demonstrating the team's commitment to quality and collaboration.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team emphasizes regression testing and output consistency verification through:\n\n- Snapshot testing for model outputs\n- Test directories organized by component\n\nEvidence of this approach can be found in:\n- `router/tests/snapshots/`\n- `backends/candle/tests/snapshots/`\n\nThis testing strategy helps ensure that changes don't unexpectedly alter model behavior.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nPull requests must follow specific formatting guidelines:\n\n- Descriptive titles that will appear in release notes\n- Detailed descriptions explaining changes, motivation, and context\n- References to fixed issues using \"Fixes # (issue)\" format\n- Completed checklist of requirements\n- Documentation of prior discussion or approval\n- Tagging of relevant reviewers\n\nThese guidelines ensure PRs are well-documented and provide context for reviewers.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses structured templates for different types of issues:\n\n- Bug reports\n- Feature requests\n- New model additions\n\nEach template (found in `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`) guides contributors to provide the necessary information for each issue type, streamlining the process of addressing different concerns.",
