    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a Python-based evaluation framework for machine learning models, with a focus on providing metrics and evaluation tools. The project uses modern development practices including testing, continuous integration, and documentation.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Python**: The primary programming language used throughout the project\n- Found in core files like `setup.py`, `src/evaluate/__init__.py`, and test files\n- The entire project structure follows Python package conventions\n\n## Frontend Frameworks\n\n- **Gradio**: Used for creating interactive demo interfaces for metrics\n- Implemented in `src/evaluate/utils/gradio.py` and various metric-specific app files\n- Allows for quick creation of web interfaces to demonstrate metric functionality\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n- **Multiple framework support**:\n  - **Transformers**: Integration for Hugging Face's Transformers library\n  - **scikit-learn**: Support for scikit-learn models and workflows\n  - **Keras**: Integration with Keras models\n- Dedicated documentation exists for each integration (`docs/source/transformers_integrations.mdx`, etc.)\n- Suggests the project is designed to work with multiple ML ecosystems\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **pytest**: Used for the project's test suite\n- Evidenced by `tests/conftest.py` and test files following the `test_*.py` naming convention\n- Structured test directory indicates comprehensive testing approach\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **setuptools**: Used as the Python package build system\n- Implemented through `setup.py` and `setup.cfg`\n- Standard approach for Python package distribution\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **pip**: Used for dependency management\n- Multiple `requirements.txt` files throughout the repository\n- Separate requirement files for different components (core, testing, specific metrics)\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and deployment\n- Multiple workflow files in `.github/workflows/` directory:\n  - `ci.yml` for continuous integration\n  - `python-release.yml` for package releases\n  - `build_documentation.yml` for documentation builds\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Used for version control\n- Standard Git configuration with `.gitignore` for excluding files from version control\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used not only for CI/CD but also for deployment processes\n- Workflows suggest automated release and documentation publishing processes",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the team based on the repository analysis. The team appears to follow structured development practices with clear guidelines for code organization, issue management, and code review processes.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team uses a module-based organization with a src layout, following Python package best practices. The code structure includes:\n\n- A main module (`evaluate`)\n- Organized submodules (`utils`, `evaluator`, etc.)\n\nThis structure promotes clean separation of concerns and makes the codebase more maintainable and navigable.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe repository uses a structured code review process with quality checks, testing requirements, and documentation standards. The process includes:\n\n1. **Pull request requirements**:\n   - Descriptive titles\n   - Issue linking\n   - WIP labeling for work in progress\n\n2. **Quality checks**:\n   - Code must pass existing tests\n   - New code must include high-coverage tests\n\n3. **Style enforcement**:\n   - Using black and isort for code formatting\n   - flake8 for code quality\n\n4. **Documentation requirements**:\n   - All public methods must have informative docstrings\n   - Documentation must be compatible with sphinx\n\n5. **Review workflow**:\n   - Maintainers may request changes\n   - Contributors are expected to implement requested changes\n   - Automated quality checks through make commands and CI pipelines\n\n6. **Repository health considerations**:\n   - Avoiding large non-text files that would weigh down the repository\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has detailed guidelines for different types of issues:\n\n### Bug Reports\nBug reports should include:\n- OS type and version, Python/PyTorch/TensorFlow versions\n- A short, self-contained code snippet for reproduction (under 30s)\n- Full traceback if an exception is raised\n- Verification that the bug hasn't already been reported\n\n### Feature Requests\nFeature requests should include:\n- Motivation (problem/frustration, project need, or community benefit)\n- A full paragraph describing the feature\n- Code snippet demonstrating future use\n- Paper link if applicable\n- Additional information like drawings or screenshots\n\n### Metric Implementation Requests\nThese have specific guidelines about:\n- Canonical vs. community metrics\n- The process for adding new metrics\n\nThe team also provides guidance on how to check if issues are already assigned and how to self-assign issues, promoting clear ownership and preventing duplicate work.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified non-functional specifications for the repository based on available information. While many typical non-functional requirements are not explicitly documented in the examined files, the following aspects were identified.\n\n## Security Standards\n\nThe repository implements robust security measures to protect sensitive information:\n\n- **Secret Scanning**: Uses TruffleHog for automated secret scanning to prevent credential leaks\n- **Implementation**: Configured as a GitHub Action in `.github/workflows/trufflehog.yml`\n- **Scope**: Runs on every push to the repository\n- **Detection Level**: Checks for both verified and unknown results, indicating a thorough approach\n- **Purpose**: Proactively prevents sensitive credentials from being accidentally committed to the codebase\n\nThis security measure demonstrates a commitment to protecting sensitive information and preventing security breaches through accidental exposure of credentials.\n\n*Note: The repository appears to have logging utilities (in `src/evaluate/utils/logging.py` and documented in `docs/source/package_reference/logging_methods.mdx`) and maintainability documentation (in `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`), but specific requirements in these areas could not be determined from the available information.*",
