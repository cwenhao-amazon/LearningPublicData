    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository demonstrates a well-structured software development approach with clear organization and standardized processes. The team has established several key practices that promote code quality, collaboration, and maintainability.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe codebase follows a modular package structure with clear separation of concerns. It's organized into logical modules based on functionality:\n\n- `src/lerobot/policies/`\n- `src/lerobot/robots/`\n- `src/lerobot/cameras/`\n- `src/lerobot/motors/`\n- `src/lerobot/teleoperators/`\n- `src/lerobot/datasets/`\n- `src/lerobot/utils/`\n\nEach module has its own directory with related components, making the codebase easier to navigate and maintain.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team follows GitHub Flow with pull requests and issue templates. This is evidenced by:\n\n- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml`\n- `.github/workflows/`\n\nThis structured approach ensures consistent contribution processes and helps maintain code quality through systematic reviews.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nPython code style is enforced by pre-commit hooks with linting and formatting tools. Key files supporting this include:\n\n- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`\n- `.github/workflows/quality.yml`\n\nThese automated tools likely include standard Python linting and formatting tools like black, flake8, and isort, ensuring consistent code style across the codebase.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team implements pull request based code reviews with templates to standardize the review process:\n\n- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`\n- `.github/workflows/fast_tests.yml`\n\nThis approach ensures that all code changes are reviewed according to consistent standards before being merged.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe repository demonstrates a commitment to comprehensive unit and integration testing with pytest:\n\n- `tests/`\n- `tests/conftest.py`\n- `tests/utils.py`\n- `.github/workflows/fast_tests.yml`\n- `.github/workflows/full_tests.yml`\n\nThe extensive test directory structure with various test types and dedicated CI workflows indicates a strong focus on automated testing to maintain code quality and prevent regressions.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses structured PRs with templates to ensure consistency:\n\n- `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`\n\nThis standardizes PR formatting and content requirements, making reviews more efficient and thorough.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nSimilarly, issues follow a structured format with templates:\n\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml`\n\nThis standardization helps ensure that bug reports and feature requests contain all necessary information.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository includes a Git commit message hook sample:\n\n- `.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample`\n\nWhile not currently active (as it's a sample file), it demonstrates how the team could enforce commit message standards, specifically checking for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines. To enable this hook, the file would need to be renamed to \"commit-msg\".",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified non-functional specifications for the repository based on the available information. While many categories lack explicit specifications, the repository does implement certain security and logging mechanisms that provide insight into its non-functional priorities.\n\n## Security Standards\n\nThe repository implements a security scanning workflow using TruffleHog (v3.90.0) through GitHub Actions. This security measure is designed to:\n\n- Run automatically on pull requests to the main branch\n- Run automatically on pushes to the main branch\n- Support manual triggering when needed\n\nThe TruffleHog scanner specifically looks for accidentally committed secrets or sensitive information in the repository's history. It's configured with the `--only-verified` flag to reduce false positives, focusing on confirmed security issues rather than potential ones.\n\nThis indicates a priority on preventing credential leakage and maintaining security hygiene in the codebase, which is particularly important for preventing unauthorized access to systems and services connected to the project.\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nThe repository features a custom metrics tracking and logging system implemented in Python, consisting of:\n\n- **AverageMeter**: A class for computing and storing average values of metrics\n- **MetricsTracker**: A class for tracking various training metrics over time (steps, samples, episodes, epochs)\n\nThis logging system provides functionality for:\n- Updating metrics during runtime\n- Displaying current values in a formatted string\n- Exporting metrics to dictionaries (compatible with tools like wandb)\n- Resetting averages when needed\n\nThe focus appears to be on numerical metrics tracking rather than traditional application logging with different log levels. This suggests the project is likely related to machine learning or data processing workflows where performance metrics and training progress are critical to monitor.",
