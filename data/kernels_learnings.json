    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the repository.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a **standard Python package structure with src layout**, which is considered a best practice in the Python community. This includes:\n\n- Source code in `src/kernels/`\n- Separate `tests/` directory\n- `examples/` directory for demonstration code\n\nThis structure provides a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate for new contributors.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team enforces consistent code style through automated tooling:\n\n- **Black** for code formatting - an opinionated Python formatter that handles whitespace, line length, quotes, and other formatting concerns\n- **Ruff** for linting - a fast Python linter that checks for code quality issues and style violations\n\nThese tools are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline through GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`), ensuring that all code contributions maintain the same style standards. This automated approach reduces style-related discussions during code reviews and maintains a consistent codebase.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe repository demonstrates a **comprehensive testing approach** that includes multiple testing strategies:\n\n- Unit tests for individual components\n- Benchmark tests for performance evaluation\n- Doctests for validating documentation examples\n- Specialized tests for specific components (e.g., interval tree, kernel locking, layer)\n\nThe variety of test files (`tests/test_basic.py`, `tests/test_benchmarks.py`, `tests/test_doctest.py`, etc.) indicates that the team values thorough testing and code quality. This multi-faceted testing approach helps ensure both correctness and performance of the codebase.\n\nWhile the repository contains GitHub workflows for testing, linting, and publishing, as well as Git hook samples, there isn't enough information to determine specific practices for version control workflows, code review standards, PR style, issue tracking, or commit message conventions.",
