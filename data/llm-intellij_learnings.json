    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin project built primarily with Kotlin that integrates Hugging Face's Large Language Model capabilities into the IDE. The project leverages the IntelliJ Platform SDK and implements the Language Server Protocol (LSP) for providing intelligent code assistance features.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Kotlin**: The primary programming language used throughout the project\n- Files include numerous `.kt` files in the `src/main/kotlin` directory\n- The build system also uses Kotlin DSL as evidenced by `.kts` extension for Gradle files\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n- **IntelliJ Platform SDK**: Used as the foundation for building the plugin\n- Evident from the project structure with `plugin.xml` and components like `LlmSettingsConfigurable`\n- Provides the necessary APIs to integrate with IntelliJ IDEA\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\n- **Language Server Protocol (LSP)**: Implemented to provide language features\n- Evident from multiple files in the `lsp` package:\n  - `LlmLsLanguageServer.kt`\n  - `LlmLsServerSupportProvider.kt`\n  - `LlmLsLspServerDescriptor.kt`\n- Enables standardized communication between the editor and language server\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Gradle with Kotlin DSL**: Used for building and managing the project\n- Key files include:\n  - `build.gradle.kts`\n  - `settings.gradle.kts`\n  - `gradlew` and `gradle/wrapper` directory\n- Provides modern build configuration with type-safe Kotlin DSL\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **Gradle**: Handles dependency management\n- Uses version catalogs through `gradle/libs.versions.toml`\n- Centralizes dependency versions and simplifies dependency declarations\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for continuous integration and delivery\n- Workflow files:\n  - `.github/workflows/build.yml`\n  - `.github/workflows/release.yml`\n- Automates building and releasing the plugin\n\n## Authentication/Security\n\n- **IntelliJ PasswordSafe API**: Used for secure credential management\n- Implemented in `SecretsService.kt`\n- Leverages IntelliJ's built-in credential management system through:\n  - `com.intellij.credentialStore.CredentialAttributes`\n  - `com.intellij.credentialStore.Credentials`\n  - `com.intellij.ide.passwordSafe.PasswordSafe`\n- Provides secure storage for sensitive information like API tokens\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n- **Hugging Face**: Integration with Hugging Face's LLM technologies\n- Evident from package name `co.huggingface.llmintellij` and files like:\n  - `LlmLsCompletionProvider.kt`\n  - `lsp/Completion.kt`\n- Enables AI-powered code completion and assistance features\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Used for version control\n- Indicated by `.git/config` and `.gitignore` files",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working practices based on the repository analysis. The team appears to follow a structured approach to code organization with some basic quality control mechanisms in place.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team uses a **package-by-feature organization** structure for their codebase. This is evident in how the code is organized within the main package `co.huggingface.llmintellij` and a dedicated subpackage for LSP-related functionality (`co.huggingface.llmintellij/lsp/`).\n\nPackage-by-feature organization groups related code together based on functionality rather than technical layers, which typically improves code navigation and maintainability by keeping related components close together.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team employs **Qodana** for static code analysis with the following specifications:\n\n- JDK version 17 is used for the project\n- Uses the recommended Qodana profile for code quality checks\n- Excludes the `.qodana` directory from analysis\n- Uses JetBrains' Qodana JVM Community linter\n\nThis suggests the team values automated code quality checks and follows JetBrains' recommended practices for Java/Kotlin development. The use of Qodana indicates a commitment to maintaining code quality through static analysis.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository has **no formal commit message convention enforced**. While there is a sample Git hook for commit messages, it remains in its default state with the `.sample` extension and has not been customized or activated.\n\nThis suggests the team may have a more flexible approach to commit messages rather than following strict conventions like Conventional Commits or requiring issue references in each commit.\n\n---\n\n*Note: Several aspects of team preferences such as version control workflows, code review standards, testing philosophy, PR style guidelines, and issue style guidelines could not be determined from the available repository information.*",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nThis repository appears to have minimal explicit non-functional specifications documented, with only security standards clearly identified. The absence of other non-functional specifications may indicate that the project either follows platform defaults or has not yet formalized these aspects.\n\n## Security Standards\n\nThe repository implements secure credential management using IntelliJ's built-in security features.\n\n### Key Security Implementation\n\nThe project leverages IntelliJ's PasswordSafe API for secure credential storage, following platform best practices for handling sensitive information like API tokens.\n\n- **Implementation Details**: The `SecretsService.kt` file demonstrates the use of IntelliJ's secure credential management system\n- **Approach**: Creates credential attributes with a specific service name (\"SecretsService\")\n- **Storage Method**: Stores credentials with empty usernames but secure password values\n\n### Security Rationale\n\nThis approach aligns with the principle of using platform-provided security features rather than implementing custom security solutions. By leveraging IntelliJ's built-in encryption and secure storage mechanisms, the project benefits from:\n\n1. Established security practices\n2. Platform-native encryption\n3. Reduced security implementation burden\n4. Consistency with IntelliJ ecosystem security patterns\n\nThe absence of other documented non-functional specifications suggests that the project may be in early development stages or relies on platform defaults for aspects like performance, scalability, and other operational characteristics.",
