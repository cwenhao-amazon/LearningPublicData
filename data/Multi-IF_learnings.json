    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository is primarily a Python-based project focused on evaluating large language models (LLMs) for instruction following tasks. It implements a custom evaluation framework that can work with both local models (via vLLM) and remote API-based models from various providers.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the exclusive programming language used in this project, as evidenced by multiple Python files (.py extensions) including utils.py, ifeval.py, metrics.py, and others. The presence of requirements.txt further confirms this as a Python project.\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\nThe backend is built with Python and focuses on machine learning libraries for natural language processing. The requirements.txt file reveals dependencies including transformers, accelerate, pandas, scipy, and several AI API clients (anthropic, mistralai, google.generativeai, openai). The codebase supports both local model inference using vLLM and remote inference through various AI service APIs.\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\nThe project implements an **Adapter Pattern with Facade elements** to provide a unified interface to different LLM APIs. The api_client.py file defines a base APIBot class with a common interface, and then implements specific adapters for different services (OpenAIBot, AnthropicBot, GeminiBot, MistralBot). Each adapter handles the specific requirements of its respective API while exposing a consistent generate() method.\n\nThe get_api_bot() function acts as a factory method that returns the appropriate adapter based on the model name. This pattern allows the application to interact with multiple LLM services through a consistent interface, hiding the complexity of each specific API implementation.\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\nRather than using standard testing frameworks like pytest or unittest, the repository implements a **custom evaluation framework** for assessing language model performance. The code in metrics.py and ifeval.py defines evaluation metrics and methods for instruction following tasks. The multi_turn_instruct_following_eval_vllm.py and multi_turn_instruct_following_eval_api.py files implement evaluation pipelines that run models through tests and collect performance metrics.\n\nThis approach is focused on evaluating model outputs rather than traditional unit or integration testing of the code itself.\n\n## Package Management\n\nThe project uses **pip** as its package manager, as indicated by the presence of requirements.txt, which is the standard dependency specification file for Python projects.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe repository leverages several machine learning frameworks and libraries:\n\n1. **Transformers** (from Hugging Face) - Used for loading and tokenizing models\n2. **vLLM** - Used for efficient inference with large language models\n3. **Various LLM API clients**:\n   - OpenAI API\n   - Anthropic API (Claude models)\n   - Google Generative AI (Gemini models)\n   - Mistral AI\n\nAdditional supporting libraries include pandas for data manipulation, scipy for statistical analysis, and nltk/pythainlp for text processing.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used as the version control system for this project, as evidenced by the presence of the .git directory and .gitignore file.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the Multi-IF team based on repository analysis. The team appears to focus on language model evaluation with an emphasis on modular code organization and basic contribution guidelines.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular organization pattern with clear separation of concerns:\n\n- **Core functionality modules**:\n  - `api_client.py`: API client implementations for different LLM providers\n  - `metrics.py`: Evaluation metrics and scoring functions\n  - `ifeval.py`: Instruction following evaluation logic\n  - `utils.py`: Utility functions for data processing and inference\n\n- **Main execution scripts**:\n  - `multi_turn_instruct_following_eval_vllm.py`: Local model evaluation using vLLM\n  - `multi_turn_instruct_following_eval_api.py`: Evaluation using remote API services\n\n- **Class hierarchy**:\n  - Base classes with specialized implementations (e.g., APIBot with provider implementations)\n  - Utility classes like GenerationSetting for configuration\n\n- **Function organization**:\n  - Clear separation between data preparation, model inference, and metrics calculation\n  - Helper functions for specific tasks\n\nThe codebase maintains consistent patterns for error handling, logging, and configuration management throughout the modules.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe repository uses Git for version control with standard hook samples present:\n- `.git/hooks/pre-push.sample`\n- `.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample`\n- `.git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg.sample`\n- `.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample`\n\nThese are standard Git hook templates that could be used to enforce workflow policies, but they remain in their default sample state and are not actively configured.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows these coding style guidelines:\n\n- **General Formatting**:\n  - 2 spaces for indentation, not tabs\n  - 80 character line length\n  - Consistent spacing around operators and after commas\n\n- **Naming Conventions**:\n  - Descriptive, meaningful names for variables, functions, and classes\n  - Standard naming conventions for the language being used\n\n- **Code Organization**:\n  - Logical modules and components\n  - Single-responsibility functions\n  - Clear separation of concerns\n\n- **Documentation**:\n  - Document public APIs\n  - Update documentation when changing APIs\n  - Include comments for complex logic\n\n- **Testing**:\n  - Add tests for new code\n  - Ensure all tests pass before submitting changes\n  - Test edge cases and error conditions\n\n- **Error Handling**:\n  - Implement proper error handling\n  - Avoid silent failures\n  - Use appropriate logging for errors\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team has basic PR requirements:\n1. Fork the repo and create branches from `main`\n2. Add tests for new code\n3. Update documentation for API changes\n4. Ensure test suite passes\n5. Make sure code lints\n6. Complete the Contributor License Agreement (CLA)\n\nThese represent basic quality checks for contributions but don't specify detailed review processes or approval thresholds.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team follows an **evaluation-driven testing approach** focused on measuring model performance rather than traditional software testing:\n\n- Multi-turn conversation evaluation\n- Strict and loose evaluation metrics\n- Statistical analysis with confidence intervals\n- Cross-language evaluation\n- Performance benchmarking\n\nThe emphasis is on quantitative metrics and reproducible evaluation procedures, focusing on evaluating model outputs rather than testing code functionality.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has basic PR workflow requirements:\n1. PRs should be created from branches forked from `main`\n2. New code should include tests when appropriate\n3. API changes must be documented\n4. PRs must pass the test suite\n5. Code must pass linting\n6. Contributors must complete the CLA\n\nThere are no specific guidelines about PR size, commit structure, or description format.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has minimal issue reporting requirements:\n- GitHub issues are used to track public bugs\n- Issue descriptions should be clear\n- Issues should include sufficient instructions to reproduce problems\n- Security bugs should be reported through Meta's bounty program instead of public issues\n\nNo specific templates, formats, or labeling conventions are mentioned for issues.",
