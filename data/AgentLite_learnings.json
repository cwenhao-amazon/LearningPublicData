    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a Python-based framework for building LLM-powered agents, with a focus on creating interactive web applications. The project uses a combination of Python libraries and frameworks to facilitate agent development, testing, and deployment.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nThe repository is primarily built with **Python**, as evidenced by:\n- Standard Python project structure with `setup.py` and `requirements.txt`\n- Python package organization with `__init__.py` files\n- Python modules throughout the codebase (e.g., `agentlite/__init__.py`, `example/SearchAgent.py`)\n\n## Frontend Frameworks\n\n**Streamlit** is used as the frontend framework for creating interactive web applications:\n- Web application structure with `app/Homepage.py`\n- Pages organized in `app/pages/` directory (e.g., `Weatherman.py`, `Philosophers.py`)\n- Custom Streamlit logger implementation (`agentlite/logging/streamlit_logger.py`)\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\nThe project uses **Python's built-in testing framework**, likely unittest or pytest:\n- Dedicated `tests/` directory containing test files\n- Test files following naming convention `test_*.py` (e.g., `tests/test_llm.py`)\n- Testing utilities in `tests/agent/agent_utils.py`\n\n## Build Systems\n\n**setuptools** is used for building and packaging the project:\n- Standard `setup.py` file defines package metadata, dependencies, and installation requirements\n- Uses `find_packages()` to automatically discover package modules\n- Reads requirements from `requirements.txt` file\n\n## Package Management\n\n**pip** is used for Python package management:\n- `requirements.txt` file lists project dependencies\n- `setup.py` integrates with pip for package installation\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe project is built around **LLM-based frameworks**:\n- Dedicated modules for LLM configuration (`agentlite/llm/LLMConfig.py`)\n- LLM integration for agents (`agentlite/llm/agent_llms.py`)\n- Prompt engineering infrastructure (`agentlite/agent_prompts/BasePrompt.py`)\n- Agent architecture designed to work with language models\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control:\n- Standard Git repository structure with `.git/config`\n- `.gitignore` file for excluding files from version control\n\nThe repository appears to be a framework for building AI agents powered by Large Language Models, with a focus on creating interactive web applications using Streamlit. The agent architecture follows object-oriented design principles with base classes and inheritance patterns.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the repository, focusing on established patterns and practices.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular package structure with clear separation of concerns. The main package 'agentlite' contains specialized subpackages for different components:\n\n- `agentlite/agents/` - Agent implementations\n- `agentlite/actions/` - Action definitions\n- `agentlite/memory/` - Memory management\n- `agentlite/llm/` - LLM integration\n- `agentlite/agent_prompts/` - Prompt templates\n- `agentlite/logging/` - Logging functionality\n- `agentlite/commons/` - Common utilities\n\nThis organization demonstrates a thoughtful architecture that separates different functional areas into distinct modules.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe codebase follows the Python PEP 8 style guide with object-oriented design patterns. Key characteristics include:\n\n- PascalCase for class files (e.g., `ABCAgent.py`, `BaseAgent.py`)\n- Lowercase with underscores for directories\n- Proper implementation of object-oriented principles:\n  - Abstract base classes (e.g., `ABCAgent.py`)\n  - Base classes for inheritance (e.g., `BaseAgent.py`, `BaseAction.py`)\n\nThis approach ensures consistency across the codebase and facilitates maintainability through proper inheritance patterns.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe repository implements code ownership designation through GitHub's CODEOWNERS file. Notably, the file includes export control classification information:\n\n- ECCN (Export Control Classification Number) marked as \"Open Source 5D002\"\n- Indicates compliance with export control standards\n\nWhile specific ownership assignments weren't visible in the provided excerpt, the structure suggests the team uses GitHub's CODEOWNERS feature to define review and approval requirements for different parts of the codebase.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows a structured PR process with a detailed contribution checklist outlined in CONTRIBUTING.md:\n\n1. Ensure an issue exists for the work\n2. Clone the repository\n3. Create a branch\n4. Make atomic commits with descriptive messages\n5. Push work\n6. Submit PR against main branch\n7. Sign Salesforce CLA\n\nThe contribution checklist specifically requires:\n- Clean, well-styled code\n- Descriptive commit messages\n- Proper comments\n- Tests\n- Minimal dependencies\n- Peer code review approval\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nIssues follow categorized templates with specific labeling conventions:\n\n- **Bug reports**:\n  - Must search existing issues first\n  - Use the \"Bug Report\" template\n  - Confirmed bugs get labeled as \"bug\"\n\n- **Feature requests**:\n  - Should describe the problem to solve\n  - Get labeled as \"enhancement\"\n\n- **For newcomers**:\n  - \"Good first contribution\" label identifies suitable starter issues\n\nThe process encourages discussion for non-trivial changes and requires opening issues before implementing significant features.",
