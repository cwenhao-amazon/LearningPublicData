    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository demonstrates a well-structured, modular approach to development with clear organization patterns and standardized processes. The team employs modern development practices with automated tooling to maintain code quality and consistency.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe project follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:\n\n- **Server**: Python-based model serving components\n- **Router**: Components handling request routing\n- **Backends**: Different backend implementations\n- **Clients**: Client libraries for interacting with the system\n\nThis organization reflects a thoughtful architectural approach that separates distinct functional areas into their own modules.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses a pull request-based workflow with standardized templates. This structured approach ensures:\n\n- Consistent information in pull requests\n- Standardized review processes\n- Clear documentation of changes\n\nThe presence of PR templates indicates the team values consistency and thoroughness in code contributions.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository enforces comprehensive coding style guidelines through pre-commit hooks:\n\n### Python Code Standards\n- **Black** (v24.2.0) for code formatting\n  - Enforces consistent, opinionated style\n  - Likely uses double quotes for strings\n  - Standard line length limits (79-88 characters)\n- **Ruff** (v0.3.0) for linting and automatic fixing\n\n### Rust Code Standards\n- **Cargo fmt** for consistent formatting\n- **Clippy** for linting and code quality checks\n\n### General Code Quality Requirements\n- YAML syntax validation\n- Files must end with newlines\n- No trailing whitespace (with specific exceptions)\n- Automatic fixing of style issues when possible\n\nThe extensive use of automated tools suggests the team prioritizes code consistency and quality, with a preference for automated enforcement rather than manual reviews for style issues.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe project demonstrates a strong commitment to integration testing, particularly for models:\n\n- Extensive integration tests for different models\n- Dedicated test directories for server components\n\nThis suggests the team values end-to-end validation of functionality, especially around model behavior, which is likely core to the project's purpose.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nPull requests follow a standardized template defined in `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`. This ensures:\n\n- Consistent PR descriptions\n- Complete information for reviewers\n- Standardized review processes\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses multiple specialized issue templates for different types of contributions:\n\n- **Bug reports**: Structured reporting of issues\n- **Feature requests**: Standardized format for proposing new features\n- **New model additions**: Specific template for adding models to the system\n\nThis multi-template approach indicates a sophisticated issue management process that recognizes different types of contributions require different information.",
