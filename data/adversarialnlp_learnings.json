    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a Python-based project focused on adversarial natural language processing (NLP), utilizing machine learning frameworks and following standard Python development practices. The project is structured as a Python package with testing capabilities and documentation hosting.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the primary programming language used in this project, as evidenced by:\n- Python-specific configuration files (setup.py, requirements.txt, .pylintrc, pytest.ini)\n- Python module structure (adversarialnlp directory with .py files)\n- The main application entry point (adversarialnlp/run.py)\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe project utilizes transformer-based machine learning models for NLP tasks:\n- **OpenAI Transformer** - Implementation found in `adversarialnlp/generators/swag/openai_transformer_model.py`\n- Language modeling capabilities through `adversarialnlp/generators/swag/simple_bilm.py`\n- The project name \"adversarialnlp\" suggests a focus on adversarial techniques in natural language processing\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n**pytest** is used as the testing framework:\n- Configured through pytest.ini\n- Tests organized in the adversarialnlp/tests/ directory\n- Follows pytest conventions for test organization\n\n## Build Systems\n\n**setuptools** is employed for building and packaging:\n- setup.py defines package metadata and dependencies\n- setup.cfg provides additional configuration\n- This allows the project to be built as a distributable Python package\n\n## Package Management\n\n**pip** is used for dependency management:\n- requirements.txt lists project dependencies\n- setup.py defines package requirements\n- This enables consistent environment setup across development and deployment\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n**ReadTheDocs** is used for documentation hosting:\n- Configured through readthedocs.yml\n- Specific documentation requirements in docs/readthedoc_requirements.txt\n- Provides accessible online documentation for the project\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control:\n- Standard .git/ directory for repository management\n- .gitignore file to exclude unnecessary files from version control",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the adversarialnlp repository. The team appears to follow standard software engineering practices with a focus on code quality and testing.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular package structure with clear separation of concerns. The codebase is organized into distinct functional areas:\n\n- `adversarialnlp/generators/` - Contains code for generating adversarial examples\n- `adversarialnlp/pruners/` - Houses pruning functionality\n- `adversarialnlp/common/` - Shared utilities and common code\n- `adversarialnlp/tests/` - Test suite for the project\n\nThis organization follows standard Python project layout conventions, making it easier for team members to locate specific functionality and maintain clear boundaries between different components.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses pylint for code style enforcement, as evidenced by the presence of a `.pylintrc` configuration file and `setup.cfg`. This indicates a commitment to maintaining consistent code style across the project, which helps with readability and reduces the cognitive load when switching between different parts of the codebase.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team employs unit testing with pytest as their testing framework. This is demonstrated by:\n\n- Presence of a `pytest.ini` configuration file\n- Structured test files with consistent naming conventions (using `_test.py` suffix)\n- Specific test files for different components, such as:\n  - `adversarialnlp/tests/generators/swag_generator_test.py`\n  - `adversarialnlp/tests/generators/addsent_generator_test.py`\n  - `adversarialnlp/tests/dataset_readers/activitynet_captions_test.py`\n\nThis approach suggests the team values code quality and reliability, with tests written to verify the functionality of individual components.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository contains standard Git commit message hooks, though they appear to be sample hooks rather than actively enforced ones. The presence of `.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample` indicates awareness of commit message standards, but there's no evidence of custom commit message formats or validation being actively enforced.",
