    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary\n\nThis repository is an Android application that implements on-device machine learning using transformer models. It primarily focuses on running Hugging Face transformer models (GPT-2 and BERT) on Android devices using TensorFlow Lite for inference.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Kotlin**: Used primarily in the GPT-2 module\n- **Java**: Used primarily in the BERT module\n- **Python**: Used in the models_generation directory, likely for preparing and converting the ML models\n\n## Frontend Frameworks\n\n- **Android native UI**: The application uses Android's native UI framework with XML layouts\n- Key UI components include activity layouts for the main interface, question answering, and dataset listing\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **JUnit**: Used for unit testing\n- **Android Instrumentation Tests**: Used for integration testing on Android devices\n- Test directories follow the standard Android project structure with separate paths for unit and instrumented tests\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Gradle**: Used as the build system for the Android application\n- Includes standard Gradle configuration files (build.gradle, settings.gradle) and wrapper scripts\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **Gradle**: Serves dual purpose as both build system and package manager\n- Dependencies are specified in the various build.gradle files throughout the project\n\n## Mobile Technologies\n\n- **Android**: The primary platform for the application\n- **TensorFlow Lite**: Used for running machine learning models on mobile devices\n- Contains standard Android project structure with AndroidManifest.xml files\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n- **TensorFlow Lite**: Used for on-device inference of machine learning models\n- **Hugging Face Transformers**: The project implements GPT-2 and BERT models from the Hugging Face ecosystem\n- Includes client implementations for both GPT-2 and BERT question-answering models\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Used for version control\n- Standard Git configuration and ignore files are present in the repository\n\nThe project demonstrates an interesting application of running complex transformer models on mobile devices, which typically have resource constraints. It bridges the gap between state-of-the-art NLP models and mobile applications by leveraging TensorFlow Lite for efficient on-device inference.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach identified in the repository, focusing on established practices and preferences across various aspects of development.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe project follows a module-based organization structure, with separate modules for different machine learning models. Each module (such as `gpt2` and `bert`) has its own:\n- Source code\n- Resources\n- Build files\n\nThis modular approach allows for better separation of concerns and more focused development on specific ML models.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\n### Android Project Coding Style Guidelines\n\n#### XML Formatting\n- Use 4-space continuation indent for XML files\n- XML attributes should follow specific ordering:\n  1. `xmlns:android` namespace declarations first\n  2. Other `xmlns:` namespace declarations ordered by name\n  3. Android attributes in the following order:\n     - id attributes\n     - name attributes\n     - standalone name attributes\n     - style attributes\n  4. Non-namespaced attributes ordered alphabetically\n  5. Android namespaced attributes following Android's standard order\n  6. Other namespaced attributes ordered alphabetically\n\n#### Example XML Layout\n```xml\n<LinearLayout\n    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n    xmlns:app=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res-auto\"\n    xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\n    android:id=\"@+id/container_main\"\n    android:name=\"com.example.MainFragment\"\n    name=\"fragment_name\"\n    style=\"@style/AppTheme\"\n    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n    android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n    android:orientation=\"vertical\"\n    app:layout_behavior=\"com.example.MyBehavior\"\n    tools:context=\".MainActivity\">\n    \n    <!-- Content here -->\n    \n</LinearLayout>\n```\n\n*Note: This is a partial style guide based on the limited information available. A complete Android project would typically have additional style guidelines for Java/Kotlin code, resource organization, etc.*\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nGit hooks are available but not actively enforced in the repository. Sample hooks include:\n\n- **Pre-push hook**: Would prevent pushing commits with messages starting with \"WIP\" (work in progress)\n- **Pre-commit hook**: Would prevent committing files with non-ASCII filenames and whitespace errors\n\nThese hooks are present as `.sample` files and would need to be renamed (removing the `.sample` extension) to be activated.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe project uses the standard Android testing framework with support for both unit and instrumented tests:\n\n1. **Unit tests**: Using JUnit that run on the development machine\n   - Located in `src/test/java/` directories\n   \n2. **Instrumented tests**: Using AndroidJUnit4 that run on Android devices/emulators\n   - Located in `src/androidTest/java/` directories\n\nThe presence of example test files suggests the project is set up for testing, though these appear to be default templates generated by Android Studio rather than custom implementations.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThere is no enforced commit message format in the repository. While a sample Git hook script for commit messages exists (`.git/hooks/commit-msg.sample`), it is not actively enforced as it retains the `.sample` extension. This sample hook only checks for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines in commit messages but doesn't enforce any particular format or structure.",
