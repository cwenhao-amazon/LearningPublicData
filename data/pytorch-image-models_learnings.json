    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the PyTorch Image Models (timm) team based on repository analysis.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular package structure with clear separation of concerns. The codebase is organized into distinct directories:\n\n- `timm/models/` - Model implementations\n- `timm/layers/` - Layer components\n- `timm/data/` - Data handling utilities\n- `timm/optim/` - Optimization algorithms\n- `timm/scheduler/` - Learning rate schedulers\n- `timm/utils/` - Utility functions\n- `timm/loss/` - Loss function implementations\n\nThis organization demonstrates a thoughtful approach to code architecture, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows PEP 8 Python style guidelines with type hints. This is evidenced by:\n\n- Dedicated typing files (`timm/layers/typing.py`, `timm/optim/_types.py`)\n- The presence of a `py.typed` marker file indicating package-wide use of type annotations\n\nType hints improve code readability and enable better IDE support and static analysis.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository follows a modified Google Python Style Guide with specific customizations:\n\n- **Line length**: 120 characters (longer acceptable for URLs and similar cases)\n- **Indentation style**: Preference for hanging indents rather than aligning with opening delimiters\n- **Formatting tool**: Black with specific options (`--skip-string-normalization --line-length 120`) for new code\n\nImportant PR guidelines include:\n- Maintaining consistent style with existing files\n- Separating formatting changes from functional changes\n- Following existing file style when there are discrepancies\n\nThese guidelines help maintain code consistency while acknowledging the evolution of the codebase over time.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses structured issue templates for bug reports and feature requests, found in:\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`\n\nThese templates help ensure that issues contain all necessary information for efficient resolution, improving the overall quality of bug reports and feature requests.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications for PyTorch Image Models (timm)\n\nThis document summarizes the identified non-functional specifications for the PyTorch Image Models repository. The project appears to be a collection of image models, training scripts, and utilities for computer vision tasks implemented in PyTorch.\n\n## Key Non-functional Priorities\n\nThe repository prioritizes:\n- Distributed training capabilities for performance scaling\n- Security through automated secret scanning\n- Structured logging with different formats for console and file outputs\n\n## Scalability Expectations\n\nThe repository supports distributed training across multiple processes on a single node using PyTorch's distributed training capabilities. This is implemented through the `distributed_train.sh` script which utilizes `torchrun` with the `--nproc_per_node` parameter.\n\nThis approach allows:\n- Training to be distributed across multiple GPU devices on a single machine\n- Improved training speed through parallel processing\n- Leveraging of PyTorch's native distributed training functionality\n\nThis design choice indicates the codebase is intended to handle large-scale model training tasks that benefit from parallelization.\n\n## Security Standards\n\nThe repository implements automated secret scanning using TruffleHog, which runs on every push to detect potential credential leaks. This is configured in the GitHub workflow file `.github/workflows/trufflehog.yml`.\n\nThis security measure:\n- Prevents accidental exposure of sensitive information in the codebase\n- Runs automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline\n- Follows security best practices for open-source repositories\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nThe repository features a custom logging setup with different formats for console and file output. This is implemented in `timm/utils/log.py` and includes:\n\n- **Dual output channels**:\n  - Console logs use a simplified format for better readability\n  - File logs include detailed information (timestamp, name, level)\n\n- **Log rotation**:\n  - 2MB file size limit (1024^2 * 2)\n  - Maintains 3 backup files\n\n- **Configurable log levels**:\n  - Default log level is INFO\n  - Can be adjusted as needed\n\nThis logging approach balances human readability for console output with comprehensive logging for debugging and analysis in the file output.",
