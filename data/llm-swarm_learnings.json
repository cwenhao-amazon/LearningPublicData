    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and standards for the repository based on the available information. While many aspects of the team's workflow remain undocumented, we can identify clear coding style guidelines that shape the development approach.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows a well-defined set of Python coding style guidelines enforced through automated tooling:\n\n### General Formatting\n- Code must be compatible with Python 3.7 and above\n- Line length appears to follow PEP 8 standards\n- Ruff is used for both code formatting and linting\n- Unused imports and variables are automatically removed\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Variables and functions use `snake_case`\n- Classes use `PascalCase`\n- Constants use `UPPER_CASE`\n\n### Code Organization\n- Imports are kept organized and unused ones are removed\n- Unused variables are eliminated for code cleanliness\n- Modular design principles are followed\n\n### Tooling\nThe team leverages several automated tools to maintain code quality:\n- **Pre-commit hooks** for automated code quality checks\n- **pyupgrade** to ensure modern Python syntax\n- **ruff** for consistent formatting and linting\n- **autoflake** to remove unused imports and variables\n\n### Example Code Pattern\n```python\nimport os\nfrom typing import Dict, List, Optional\n\n# Constants should be UPPER_CASE\nDEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 60\nMAX_RETRIES = 3\n\nclass DataProcessor:\n    \"\"\"Process data with configurable parameters.\"\"\"\n    \n    def __init__(self, config: Optional[Dict] = None):\n        self.config = config or {}\n        self.processed_items = 0\n    \n    def process_items(self, items: List[str]) -> Dict[str, int]:\n        \"\"\"Process a list of items and return statistics.\n        \n        Args:\n            items: List of items to process\n            \n        Returns:\n            Dictionary with processing statistics\n        \"\"\"\n        results = {}\n        \n        for item in items:\n            # Process each item according to configuration\n            processed = self._process_single_item(item)\n            if processed:\n                self.processed_items += 1\n                results[item] = self.processed_items\n                \n        return results\n    \n    def _process_single_item(self, item: str) -> bool:\n        \"\"\"Process a single item.\n        \n        Args:\n            item: Item to process\n            \n        Returns:\n            Success status of processing\n        \"\"\"\n        # Implementation details\n        return len(item) > 0\n```\n\nThe team's emphasis on automated code quality tools suggests a development philosophy that values consistency, cleanliness, and maintainability. By automating style enforcement, the team can focus more on functionality and less on formatting debates during code reviews.",
