    "summary": "# Tech Choices for Stable Baselines3\n\nStable Baselines3 is a Python-based reinforcement learning library built on PyTorch. The project focuses on providing reliable implementations of reinforcement learning algorithms with a clean, consistent API.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Python**: The entire codebase is written in Python, as evidenced by the presence of `setup.py`, Python module files with `.py` extensions, and the standard Python package structure with `__init__.py` files.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n- **PyTorch**: The library is built on PyTorch, as shown by files like `stable_baselines3/common/torch_layers.py` and `stable_baselines3/common/policies.py`. PyTorch provides the underlying tensor operations and neural network capabilities needed for implementing reinforcement learning algorithms.\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n- **Python's unittest or pytest**: The repository contains a comprehensive test suite with:\n  - Numerous test files following the `test_*.py` naming pattern\n  - A dedicated `tests` directory with `__init__.py`\n  - A test runner script (`scripts/run_tests.sh`)\n  - A `.coveragerc` file for test coverage reporting\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **setuptools**: The project uses Python's setuptools for building and packaging the library, as indicated by the presence of `setup.py` and `setup.cfg` files.\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **pip**: The standard Python package installer is supported through the `setup.py` configuration\n- **conda**: The presence of `docs/conda_env.yml` indicates Conda environment support, providing an alternative installation method for users who prefer Conda for package management\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Docker**: The project provides containerization support through:\n  - `Dockerfile` for container definition\n  - `.dockerignore` to exclude unnecessary files\n  - Docker-related scripts:\n    - `scripts/build_docker.sh`\n    - `scripts/run_docker_gpu.sh`\n    - `scripts/run_docker_cpu.sh`\n  - Separate scripts for CPU and GPU environments, showing consideration for different hardware requirements\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Configured through `.github/workflows/ci.yml`\n- **GitLab CI**: Configured through `.gitlab-ci.yml`\n- The project maintains configurations for both CI platforms, ensuring broad compatibility and integration options\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: The repository uses Git for version control, as evidenced by the `.git/` directory and `.gitignore` file",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the Stable Baselines 3 team based on repository analysis. The team employs a structured, quality-focused development process with clear guidelines for contributions and code organization.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe codebase follows a modular organization pattern:\n- Algorithm-specific modules in dedicated directories (a2c, ppo, dqn, etc.)\n- Shared functionality centralized in the `common` directory\n- Each algorithm has its own directory with dedicated policy implementations\n\nThis structure promotes separation of concerns and code reusability across different reinforcement learning algorithms.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses a pull request-based workflow with structured templates:\n- Standardized PR templates guide contributors through the submission process\n- Issue templates for different types of contributions and problems\n- Organized approach to tracking changes and contributions\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nCode quality is maintained through:\n- Adherence to PEP 8 Python style guide\n- Use of type hints for static type checking (evidenced by `py.typed` file)\n- Custom type aliases defined in `type_aliases.py`\n- Maximum line length of 127 characters\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team implements a comprehensive code review process with:\n- Required checks marked explicitly in the PR template\n- Checklist approach where contributors must mark completed items\n- Classification of changes (bug fix, new feature, breaking change, documentation)\n- Requirement to raise an issue before proposing changes\n- Automated checks available through `make commit-checks`\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nQuality assurance is prioritized through:\n- Comprehensive unit testing with numerous test files\n- Test coverage tracking via `.coveragerc`\n- Requirement for tests to pass before PR approval\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nPull requests must follow a structured format including:\n- Title that summarizes changes\n- Detailed description section\n- Motivation and context section with issue linking (using \"closes #100\" syntax)\n- Categorization of change types with checkboxes\n- Comprehensive checklist of requirements\n- Code style requirements including formatting with \"make format\"\n- Required changelog updates\n- Documentation updates when applicable\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses structured issue templates for different purposes:\n- Bug reports\n- Feature requests\n- Questions\n- Documentation issues\n- Custom environment issues\n\nEach template guides users to provide specific information needed for that issue type, ensuring consistency and completeness in issue reporting.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be for Stable Baselines 3, a reinforcement learning library. Based on the available information, there are limited explicitly defined non-functional specifications, with only logging requirements clearly identified.\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nThe repository implements a custom logging solution as evidenced by:\n- `stable_baselines3/common/logger.py`: A dedicated module for logging functionality\n- `tests/test_logger.py`: Tests specifically for the logging implementation\n\nThe presence of a custom logger module with corresponding tests suggests that logging is a significant aspect of the system, likely for tracking training progress, model performance, and debugging purposes in the reinforcement learning context.\n\nWhile other non-functional aspects like performance optimization (vectorized environments, GPU support) and maintainability (presence of CONTRIBUTING.md and CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) are hinted at in the repository structure, specific requirements for these areas are not explicitly defined in the available information.",
