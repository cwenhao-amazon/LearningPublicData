    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository is primarily built with JavaScript/Node.js, using EJS for templating and a simple JSON-based file storage system. The application appears to implement WebSockets for real-time communication, particularly in the dana-bot component. The project uses npm for package management and Git for version control.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **JavaScript/Node.js**: The primary programming language used throughout the repository\n- Found in key files like `src/server.js`, `src/analyse.js`, and `dana-bot/src/bot.js`\n- The codebase is consistently JavaScript-based with no other programming languages evident\n\n## Frontend Frameworks\n\n- **EJS (Embedded JavaScript templates)**: Used as the templating engine for views\n- Implemented in various directories including `www/views/common/page.ejs`, `dana-bot/www/views/login/login.ejs`, and `demo/projects/Test/sidebar.ejs`\n- Allows for embedding JavaScript directly in HTML templates\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n- **Node.js**: Powers the server-side application logic\n- **Express.js**: Likely used as the web application framework\n- Evidenced by the structure of `src/server.js` and `dana-bot/src/server.js` files\n- The organization of views and routes is consistent with Express.js patterns\n\n## Database Systems\n\n- **JSON-based file storage**: Used instead of a traditional database system\n- Data is stored in JSON files like `demo/configs/db/admin/projects.json` and `demo/configs/db/admin/compares.json`\n- Suggests a lightweight approach to data persistence\n\n## API Design Patterns\n\n- **WebSockets**: Implemented for real-time communication between components\n- Files with `.ws.js` extensions in the dana-bot/src directory indicate WebSocket usage\n- Examples include `dana-bot/src/runnerNetMaster.ws.js`, `dana-bot/src/masterNetRunner.ws.js`, and `dana-bot/src/runnerProcess.ws.js`\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **npm**: Used for managing JavaScript dependencies\n- Evidenced by `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files in both the root directory and dana-bot directory\n- Handles all project dependencies and scripts\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Used for source code management\n- Standard Git configuration files present (`.git/config`, `.gitignore`, `.gitattributes`, `.gitmodules`)\n- The presence of `.gitmodules` suggests the project may include Git submodules",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key preferences and practices identified in the repository, focusing on how the team organizes their work and maintains code quality.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a modular organization structure with clearly separated components:\n\n- `src/` - Contains the main source code\n- `dana-bot/src/` - Dedicated to bot-related code\n- `www/` - Houses the web interface components\n- `docs/` - Stores documentation\n- `demo/` - Contains demonstration materials\n- `third_party/` - Manages external libraries and dependencies\n\nThis organization demonstrates a clean separation of concerns, making it easier to navigate and maintain different aspects of the project.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses Git for version control with potential for automated quality checks through Git hooks:\n\n- Sample pre-commit hooks are available to check for:\n  - Non-ASCII filenames\n  - Whitespace errors\n- Sample pre-push hooks are configured to:\n  - Prevent pushing commits with \"WIP\" (work in progress) messages\n\nWhile these hooks are currently in sample form (not actively enforced), their presence indicates the team's interest in implementing automated quality controls in their workflow.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team adheres to the Google JavaScript Style Guide, enforced through ESLint configuration. Key aspects include:\n\n- **Formatting**:\n  - 2-space indentation\n  - Maximum line length of 80 characters\n  - Required semicolons\n  - Single quotes for strings\n  - No spaces inside parentheses\n  - One space after keywords\n  - Braces required even for single-line blocks\n\n- **Naming Conventions**:\n  - camelCase for variables and functions\n  - PascalCase for classes\n\n- **Code Quality**:\n  - Strict mode required\n  - Consistent error handling with try/catch patterns\n  - JSDoc style comments for documentation\n\nThe team uses ESLint with the `eslint-config-google` extension without overrides, indicating strict adherence to Google's comprehensive JavaScript style guidelines.\n\nThis standardized approach to code style helps maintain consistency across the codebase and simplifies collaboration between team members.",

    "summary": "# Non-Functional Specifications Summary\n\n# Non-Functional Specifications\n\nThis project appears to have minimal non-functional specifications with only one identified aspect:\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nThe project implements a custom logging solution as evidenced by dedicated logger.js files in both the main source directory and the dana-bot subdirectory. This suggests the application prioritizes capturing operational data about system behavior and application events, which is important for troubleshooting and monitoring. The presence of these dedicated logging files indicates an emphasis on maintaining visibility into the application's runtime behavior.\n\nThe custom logging implementation likely serves several purposes:\n- Capturing application events and errors\n- Providing troubleshooting capabilities\n- Supporting operational monitoring\n- Enabling debugging and issue resolution\n\nThis suggests the project values observability and places importance on being able to understand system behavior during operation.",
