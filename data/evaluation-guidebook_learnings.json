    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository is primarily focused on Large Language Model (LLM) evaluation, using Python as the main programming language. The project appears to be a research or educational resource for working with and evaluating LLMs, with implementation in Jupyter notebooks.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython is the primary programming language used in this project. This is evidenced by the presence of Jupyter notebook files (.ipynb extension) in the repository, such as `contents/examples/comparing_task_formulations.ipynb`. Python is a natural choice for machine learning and LLM work due to its rich ecosystem of data science and ML libraries.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe repository is centered around LLM (Large Language Models) technology. Multiple files in the repository discuss:\n- Model inference and evaluation (`contents/general-knowledge/model-inference-and-evaluation.md`)\n- Using LLMs as judges for evaluation (`contents/model-as-a-judge/basics.md`)\n- Obtaining and working with judge LLMs (`contents/model-as-a-judge/getting-a-judge-llm.md`)\n\nThis suggests that the project is focused on developing methodologies or frameworks for evaluating LLM performance, possibly implementing the \"model-as-a-judge\" paradigm where one LLM is used to evaluate the outputs of another.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\nGit is used as the version control system for this project, as indicated by the presence of the standard Git directory structure (`.git/config`, `.git/HEAD`, `.git/index`). This is the industry standard for source code management and enables collaborative development.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be focused on content organization and translation management, with a clear structure for maintaining multilingual resources. The team has established specific workflows for content organization and translation contributions, though many standard development practices are not explicitly defined.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a topic-based organization structure with content categorized into distinct domains:\n\n- Content is organized by specific topics:\n  - Troubleshooting\n  - Model-as-a-judge\n  - Human evaluation\n  - General knowledge\n  - Automated benchmarks\n\n- Translations are maintained in parallel structures:\n  - Each language has its own directory (using ISO 639-2 language codes)\n  - The translation directories mirror the original content structure\n\nThis organization demonstrates a commitment to maintaining clear separation of concerns while ensuring consistency across language versions.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has established a structured process specifically for translation contributions:\n\n1. Fork the repository\n2. Create a branch named `adding_<langcode>`\n3. Create language folders using ISO 639-2 codes\n4. Maintain the existing folder architecture\n5. Submit a PR to the main repository\n6. Expect review and possible edits before merging\n\nThese guidelines ensure consistency in how translations are contributed and integrated into the main codebase, making the review process more efficient.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nWhile the repository has clear guidelines for translation contributions, there are no specific templates or structured formats for issue reporting. Contributors likely follow general GitHub issue practices rather than repository-specific formats.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository does not enforce any specific commit message format. The standard Git hook samples for commit messages are present but remain in their default state without customization or activation.\n\nThis suggests the team may follow informal or unstated conventions for commit messages rather than a strictly enforced standard.",
