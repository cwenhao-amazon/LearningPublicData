    "summary": "# Tech Stack Overview\n\nThis repository appears to be a machine learning evaluation project that combines a TypeScript/React frontend with a Python backend. The project likely interfaces with Hugging Face for authentication and model inference, with Docker used for deployment.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **TypeScript**: Used for frontend development with React components\n- **Python**: Used for backend services and evaluation scripts\n\nKey files include `src/main.tsx`, `src/App.tsx` for TypeScript, and `api.py`, `parallel_eval/proctor.py`, `parallel_eval/game.py` for Python.\n\n## Frontend Frameworks\n\n- **React**: The primary frontend framework\n\nEvidenced by `.tsx` files, React component structure, and assets like `src/assets/react.svg`. The project structure follows typical React application patterns.\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\n- **Python**: Powers the backend services\n\nThe backend is implemented in Python, with files like `api.py` and various scripts in the `parallel_eval` directory. Dependencies are managed through `requirements.txt`.\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Docker**: Used for containerization\n\nThe presence of a `Dockerfile` indicates the application is containerized using Docker, likely for consistent deployment across environments.\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Vite**: Frontend build tool\n\nThe project uses Vite as its frontend build system, as evidenced by `vite.config.ts` and `public/vite.svg`. Vite provides fast development server and optimized production builds for modern web projects.\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **npm/yarn**: JavaScript dependency management\n\nBoth `package-lock.json` and `yarn.lock` files are present, suggesting the project either transitioned between npm and yarn or supports both package managers for developer flexibility.\n\n## Authentication/Security\n\n- **Hugging Face authentication**: Used for user authentication\n\nThe project implements Hugging Face authentication as shown by `src/components/sign-in-with-hf-button.tsx`, likely to leverage Hugging Face's ecosystem for machine learning models.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Used for source code management\n\nStandard Git version control is implemented with `.git/` directory and `.gitignore` file for excluding files from version control.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and standards identified in the repository. The team appears to follow modern web development practices with a focus on structured code organization and consistent coding styles.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:\n\n- **UI Components**: Located in `src/components/ui/`\n- **Feature Components**: Located in `src/components/`\n- **Business Logic**: Located in `src/lib/`\n\nThis structure demonstrates a thoughtful approach to code organization, making it easier to maintain and scale the application by separating presentation from business logic.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows comprehensive coding standards that emphasize type safety, consistency, and modern JavaScript practices:\n\n### General Guidelines\n- Use TypeScript for type safety\n- Follow ESLint recommended configurations\n- Use modern ECMAScript features (ES2020)\n- Maintain consistent formatting with ESLint rules\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Use camelCase for variables and functions\n- Use PascalCase for components and classes\n- Use descriptive, meaningful names\n\n### Code Organization\n- Organize imports by type (built-in, external, internal)\n- Group related functionality in modules\n- Export components as default when they're the main export\n\n### React-Specific Guidelines\n- Follow React Hooks rules (enforced by eslint-plugin-react-hooks)\n- Use functional components with hooks\n- Implement proper component refresh handling\n\nThe presence of an `eslint.config.js` file indicates that these standards are enforced through automated linting, which helps maintain consistency across the codebase. The configuration shows the team values modern development practices, including React's Fast Refresh feature for improved developer experience.",

    "summary": "# Non-Functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the repository analysis, there are no explicit non-functional specifications identified in the codebase. The repository does not contain any clear documentation or code that specifies performance requirements, scalability expectations, security standards, maintainability goals, or any other non-functional aspects.\n\nThe repository appears to lack explicit non-functional specifications across all examined dimensions. This suggests either:\n\n1. These requirements are not documented in the repository\n2. They may exist elsewhere outside the codebase (perhaps in external documentation)\n3. They may be implicit rather than explicit\n4. They may not have been formally defined for the project\n\nThis absence of non-functional specifications could indicate an area for improvement in the project's documentation and architecture planning.",
