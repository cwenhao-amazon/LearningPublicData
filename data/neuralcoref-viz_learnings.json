    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a web-based project that uses a combination of modern JavaScript technologies with a focus on TypeScript. Below is a summary of the key technologies and tools identified in the codebase.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **JavaScript and TypeScript**: The project uses both JavaScript and TypeScript, with TypeScript files (.ts) found in the js-src directory including components like SvgArrow.ts, Coref.ts, Displacy.ts, and zController.ts\n- A TypeScript configuration file (tsconfig.json) is present to manage TypeScript compilation settings\n\n## Build Systems\n\n- **Grunt**: The project uses Grunt as its task runner/build system, as evidenced by the Gruntfile.js\n- Grunt likely handles tasks such as TypeScript compilation, minification, and other build processes\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **npm**: Used as the primary package manager, with standard package.json and package-lock.json files present\n- **Bower**: Also employed for frontend dependency management (bower.json), which suggests this might be a slightly older project as Bower has declined in popularity in recent years\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **Custom Shell Script Deployment**: The project uses a custom shell script (deploy.sh) for deployment rather than relying on a specialized deployment platform\n- This suggests a straightforward deployment process, possibly to a simple hosting environment\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: The project uses Git for version control, as indicated by the presence of the .git directory and .gitignore file\n\nThe project appears to be a web-based visualization tool, possibly related to natural language processing or text analysis, given component names like \"Coref\" (likely coreference resolution) and \"Displacy\" (which might be related to visualization of linguistic structures).",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe codebase is organized by file type and functionality, with dedicated directories for:\n- `js-src/` for TypeScript source files\n- `less/` for LESS stylesheets\n- `assets/` for static resources (images and SVGs)\n\nThis structure suggests a clean separation of concerns where code, styling, and assets are maintained in their respective directories, making it easier to navigate and maintain the codebase.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository includes a sample Git hook (`commit-msg.sample`) that checks for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines in commit messages, but it's not actively used as it remains in its sample form. This suggests the team doesn't have formalized commit message requirements implemented through Git hooks.\n\n# General Observations\n\nThe repository appears to follow a standard structure with TypeScript as the primary programming language, using LESS for styling. While there are sample Git hooks available, they haven't been activated, indicating that automated enforcement of workflows or standards isn't currently implemented.\n\nThe organization by file type and functionality demonstrates a clean approach to code organization that would help team members quickly locate relevant files based on their purpose.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided repository analysis, there are no explicit non-functional specifications documented in the codebase. The analysis did not identify any defined performance requirements, scalability expectations, security standards, maintainability goals, memory/CPU constraints, load testing parameters, caching strategies, logging requirements, audit trail requirements, or network requirements.\n\nThis suggests that the project either:\n- Has these specifications documented elsewhere (outside the repository)\n- Relies on implicit understanding among team members\n- Is in early development stages where non-functional requirements have not yet been formalized\n- Focuses primarily on functional aspects with non-functional aspects considered secondary\n\nWithout explicit non-functional specifications, the project may face challenges in ensuring consistent performance, security, and maintainability as it scales. It would be advisable to document these requirements to guide future development efforts.",
