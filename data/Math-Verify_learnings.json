    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a Python-based project focused on mathematical verification and model evaluation, likely in a machine learning context. The tech stack is relatively minimal, with a focus on Python development tools and testing infrastructure.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n**Python** is the primary programming language used in this project, as evidenced by:\n- Python source files with `.py` extensions throughout the repository\n- Python-specific configuration files like `pyproject.toml`\n- The project structure follows Python conventions with a `src` directory containing the main package\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\n**pytest** is used as the testing framework, which is a standard choice for Python projects. This is demonstrated by:\n- Multiple test files in a dedicated `tests` directory\n- Test files following the naming convention `test_*.py` (e.g., `test_all.py`, `test_boxed.py`)\n- Various specialized test files suggesting comprehensive test coverage for different aspects of the project:\n  - `test_configs.py`\n  - `test_numina_cases.py`\n  - `test_open_thoughts.py`\n  - `test_raise_on_error.py`\n  - `test_strict.py`\n  - `test_string_extraction.py`\n  - `test_timeout.py`\n  - `test_yujianll.py`\n\n## Package Management\n\n**Python package management** tools are used, likely **pip** or **poetry**, as indicated by:\n- The presence of `pyproject.toml`, which follows PEP 518 specifications for Python package build system requirements\n- This modern approach to Python packaging suggests the project follows contemporary Python development practices\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as shown by:\n- The presence of a `.git` directory and configuration file\n- `.gitignore` file for specifying intentionally untracked files\n- `.gitmodules` file, indicating the project uses Git submodules for managing dependencies or related repositories\n\nWhile there are files related to model evaluation (`evaluate_model.py`, `evaluate_model_outputs.py`, `src/math_verify/metric.py`), the repository doesn't explicitly indicate which machine learning frameworks are being used. The project appears to be focused on mathematical verification, possibly for evaluating the performance of machine learning models on mathematical tasks.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach identified in the math-verify repository, highlighting key aspects of the team's development practices.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a standard Python package structure with a src layout:\n- Main package code in `src/math_verify/`\n- Separate `tests/` directory for test files\n- `examples/` directory for demonstration code\n\nThis organization indicates a well-structured Python project that separates concerns appropriately.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team has established comprehensive coding style guidelines:\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- Snake_case for variables, functions, and modules\n- PascalCase for classes\n- Package name uses hyphens (math-verify), but imports use underscores (math_verify)\n\n### Formatting\n- Line length: 88 characters maximum\n- Double quotes for strings\n- 4 spaces for indentation\n- PEP 8 conventions with specific Ruff rules\n\n### Code Organization\n- Source code in src/ directory\n- Package structure follows standard Python project layout\n- Explicit imports with isort configuration\n\n### Tool Configuration\n- Ruff for linting and formatting\n- Black as a formatting standard\n- Import sorting with isort (via Ruff)\n\nThe team uses modern Python tooling to enforce consistent code style across the codebase, with specific configurations in `pyproject.toml`.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe repository demonstrates a comprehensive unit testing approach with specific test cases:\n- Extensive test suite with specialized test files for different features\n- Tests for edge cases and specific functionality\n- Multiple test files targeting different aspects of the system:\n  - General functionality (`test_all.py`)\n  - Boxed execution (`test_boxed.py`)\n  - Configuration handling (`test_configs.py`)\n  - Error handling (`test_raise_on_error.py`)\n  - Timeout functionality (`test_timeout.py`)\n  - And several others\n\nThis thorough testing approach suggests the team values robust code quality and comprehensive test coverage.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses a structured, semantic commit message style organized in a changelog with versioned releases:\n\n1. Version headers using semantic versioning (e.g., [0.8.0])\n2. Changes grouped into categories:\n   - \"Added\" for new features\n   - \"Changed\" for modifications to existing functionality\n   - \"Fixed\" for bug fixes\n   - \"Removed\" for removed features\n\nEach change is described with a concise bullet point that clearly explains what was modified, often including technical details about specific functions or components affected.\n\nThis structured approach to commit messages and changelog maintenance indicates a disciplined development process focused on clear communication of changes to users and other developers.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided data, there is very limited information available about the non-functional specifications for this repository. The only potential insight relates to performance requirements, with timeout-related files that might indicate performance constraints, but without sufficient details to make definitive conclusions.\n\nThe repository appears to have minimal explicit non-functional specifications documented. The presence of timeout-related files (`src/math_verify/timeout.py` and `tests/test_timeout.py`) suggests that the system may have some performance timing constraints, possibly to prevent long-running operations or to ensure responsiveness under certain conditions.\n\nWithout additional context or documentation, it's not possible to provide a comprehensive summary of the non-functional requirements for this project. A more detailed analysis would require examining the content of the identified files and other project documentation.",
