    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the team based on repository analysis. The team follows a structured, quality-focused development process with clear guidelines for code organization, testing, and contribution workflows.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a **modular package structure with clear separation of concerns**. The codebase is organized into logical modules based on functionality:\n\n- `optimum/onnxruntime/`\n- `optimum/exporters/`\n- `optimum/fx/`\n- `optimum/utils/`\n\nEach module has its own directory with distinct responsibilities, promoting maintainability and organization.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team follows **GitHub Flow with pull requests** for code integration. This is evidenced by:\n\n- Pull request template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`)\n- GitHub Actions workflows (`.github/workflows/`)\n\nThis approach ensures code changes are reviewed before integration into the main codebase.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team adheres to **PEP 8 with automated style checking**. Style enforcement is implemented through:\n\n- Quality checks (`.github/workflows/quality.yml`)\n- Style bot automation (`.github/workflows/style_bot.yml`)\n\nThese automated checks help maintain consistent code quality and style across the codebase.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team employs **comprehensive testing with unit, integration, and documentation tests**. The testing approach includes:\n\n- Component-specific test directories (`tests/onnxruntime/`, `tests/exporters/`, `tests/fx/`)\n- Documentation testing (`tests/run_doctest.sh`, `tests/utils/documentation_tests.txt`)\n- Testing guidelines (`tests/README.md`)\n\nThis thorough testing philosophy ensures code reliability and helps prevent regressions.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses **structured PRs with templates** to standardize the pull request process. The PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) likely includes:\n\n- Description of changes\n- Related issues\n- Testing information\n- Checklist for contributors\n\nThis structured approach helps reviewers understand changes and ensures necessary information is provided.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team employs **structured issues with templates for bugs and features**. Issue templates include:\n\n- Feature request template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature-request.yml`)\n- Bug report template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug-report.yml`)\n\nThese YAML-based templates ensure consistent issue reporting with all necessary information for addressing bugs or implementing features.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe team follows **pull request based reviews with templates**. The PR template (`.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`) standardizes the code review process by:\n\n- Providing structured information requirements\n- Ensuring consistent review criteria\n- Facilitating efficient feedback\n\nThis approach helps maintain code quality through peer review before changes are merged.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\n## Overview\n\nThe repository appears to be focused on optimization for machine learning models, particularly in the ONNX runtime environment. The non-functional specifications identified primarily relate to security measures, caching strategies for performance optimization, and a robust logging system. These elements suggest a focus on security, performance, and maintainability as key non-functional priorities.\n\n## Security Standards\n\nThe repository implements proactive security measures to protect sensitive information:\n\n- **TruffleHog for secret scanning**: Configured as a GitHub workflow that runs on every push to the repository\n- This tool automatically scans the codebase for potential leaked secrets, API keys, credentials, and other sensitive information\n- Represents a preventative approach to security by catching credential leakage before it becomes problematic\n\nThis security implementation demonstrates a commitment to protecting sensitive information and preventing accidental exposure of credentials in the codebase.\n\n## Caching Strategies\n\nThe repository implements a sophisticated caching framework designed for machine learning model optimization:\n\n- **Abstract caching framework with key-value state management**\n- Implemented through a `TraceableCache` abstract base class\n- Key features include:\n  - Mechanisms to update and retrieve key-value states for specific layers\n  - Methods to manage cache sequence length and maximum capacity\n  - Support for cache reordering (particularly for beam search operations)\n  - Functions to determine usable cache length based on new sequence inputs\n  - Handling of cache position tracking\n\nThis caching strategy appears to be specifically designed for transformer models, where caching previous key-value pairs can significantly improve inference performance. The abstract design allows for concrete implementations with specific caching behaviors tailored to different use cases.\n\n## Logging Requirements\n\nA comprehensive logging system is implemented with extensive configuration options:\n\n- **Hierarchical logging system with configurable verbosity levels**\n- Multiple verbosity levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)\n- Default logging level set to WARNING\n- Environment variable configuration via `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY`\n- Library-specific root logger that can be configured independently\n- Features include:\n  - Handler management (add, remove, enable, disable)\n  - Propagation control to parent loggers\n  - Detailed formatting options including timestamp, level, filename, and line number\n  - Thread-safe configuration with locking mechanism\n  - A `warn_once` utility to prevent duplicate warning messages\n  - Functions to get and set verbosity levels\n\nThe logging system appears to be adapted from the Hugging Face Transformers library and provides fine-grained control over logging behavior, which is essential for debugging and monitoring machine learning operations.",
