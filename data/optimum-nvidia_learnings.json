    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the team based on the repository structure and configuration files.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular Python package structure with a src layout. The codebase is organized into logical modules within the `optimum.nvidia` namespace:\n\n- `src/optimum/nvidia/` - Main package directory\n- `src/optimum/commands/` - Command-line interfaces\n- `src/optimum/nvidia/models/` - Model implementations\n- `src/optimum/nvidia/utils/` - Utility functions and helpers\n- `src/optimum/nvidia/pipelines/` - Processing pipelines\n\nThis structure demonstrates a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase more maintainable and easier to navigate.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team follows a GitHub Flow model with PR-based development. This is evidenced by several GitHub Actions workflows:\n\n- `.github/workflows/pr_tests.yml`\n- `.github/workflows/pr_quality.yml`\n- `.github/workflows/pr_secrets_scan.yml`\n\nThis approach ensures that all changes are proposed via pull requests that undergo automated testing, quality checks, and security scanning before being merged into the main codebase.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team embraces comprehensive testing with both unit and integration tests. The testing structure is well-organized:\n\n- Unit tests: `tests/test_dtype.py`, `tests/test_misc.py`, `tests/test_hub.py`\n- CLI tests: `tests/cli/test_export.py`\n- Integration tests: `tests/integration/test_causal_lm.py`\n- Testing utilities: \n  - `tests/integration/utils_testing.py`\n  - `src/optimum/nvidia/utils/tests/assertions.py`\n\nThe presence of dedicated testing utility files suggests a systematic and thorough approach to testing, with custom assertions and helpers to facilitate test creation and maintenance.\n\nWhile the repository doesn't contain explicit documentation on coding style guidelines, code review standards, PR style guidelines, or commit message conventions, the presence of configuration files like `setup.cfg` and `pyproject.toml`, along with quality-checking workflows, indicates that the team likely follows standardized practices enforced through automation.",
