    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a relatively simple project with minimal technology stack. Based on the available information, here's a summary of the technical choices identified in the codebase.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nThe project primarily uses **JavaScript** for its implementation. This is evidenced by the presence of a JavaScript file (`share-canvas.js`) in the repository. The code appears to be vanilla JavaScript with DOM manipulation, canvas operations, and fetch API for HTTP requests.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\nThe project uses **Git** for version control, as indicated by the presence of a standard `.git` directory containing configuration files and references. This includes:\n- `.git/config`\n- `.git/HEAD`\n- `.git/refs/heads/main`\n- `.git/refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`\n\nThis is a standard choice for modern software development, allowing for distributed version control and collaboration.\n\n---\n\nThe repository appears to be a simple project, possibly focused on canvas sharing functionality as suggested by the filename `share-canvas.js`. No frontend frameworks are used, with the code instead relying on vanilla JavaScript. There is insufficient information to determine other aspects of the technology stack such as backend technologies, database systems, or deployment infrastructure.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working styles based on the repository analysis. The team appears to follow standard Git practices with some specific JavaScript coding conventions.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses a standard Git workflow with sample hooks available but not actively implemented. The repository contains the default Git hook samples:\n- pre-push.sample\n- pre-commit.sample\n- prepare-commit-msg.sample\n- commit-msg.sample\n\nThese hooks demonstrate potential checks like:\n- Preventing WIP commits from being pushed\n- Checking for non-ASCII filenames\n- Preventing duplicate signed-off-by lines\n\nHowever, since these hooks retain their `.sample` extension, they are not actively enforced in the workflow. There's no evidence of a specific branching strategy or PR template being used.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows a consistent JavaScript coding style that emphasizes readability and maintainability:\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- **Variables and Functions**: camelCase (e.g., `shareToCommunity`, `buttonEle`)\n- **Parameters**: Descriptive names indicating purpose (e.g., `canvasID`, `buttonEleID`)\n- **Constants**: ALL_CAPS (e.g., `UPLOAD_URL`)\n\n### Function Structure\n- Single responsibility focus for each function\n- Async/await pattern for asynchronous operations\n- Explicit return values at function end\n\n### Formatting\n- 2-space indentation throughout\n- Opening braces on the same line as statements\n- Template literals for string interpolation\n- Empty lines between logical code sections\n- Line length limited to approximately 80 characters with appropriate wrapping\n\n### Modern JavaScript Practices\n- ES6+ features are utilized\n- DOM manipulation via direct getElementById calls\n- Fetch API for HTTP requests\n- Global exposure of functions via globalThis\n\n### Error Handling\n- Minimal error handling appears to be the norm, as explicit error handling is not present in the example code\n\nThe team's JavaScript code demonstrates a focus on clean, readable code with modern practices and consistent formatting conventions.\n\nMarkdown: # Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working styles based on the repository analysis.
