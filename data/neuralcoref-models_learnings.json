    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and practices for the NeuralCoref model hosting repository. The information available is limited, but provides some insights into how the team organizes their work.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository serves a specific purpose as a model hosting repository for the NeuralCoref coreference resolution module. It appears to be a companion repository to the main NeuralCoref project, which is linked in the README.\n\nThe team has adopted a separation of concerns approach, where:\n- Code implementation is maintained in the main repository\n- Trained models are stored and distributed in this separate repository\n\nThis separation allows for more efficient management of model releases without cluttering the main codebase.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe repository includes standard Git commit message hooks with optional signed-off-by verification. The presence of a sample commit-msg hook suggests the team may use or consider using:\n\n- Verification of commit message format\n- Checking for duplicate \"Signed-off-by\" lines\n- Potentially requiring signed-off-by attestations for contributions\n\nWhile the hook exists as a sample file and may not be actively enforced, its presence indicates awareness of commit message standards.",

The analysis did not yield any information about performance requirements, scalability expectations, security standards, maintainability goals, memory/CPU constraints, load testing parameters, caching strategies, logging requirements, audit trail requirements, or network requirements.\n\nThis suggests that the repository may not have formal documentation for these aspects, or they may be defined elsewhere outside the codebase. It would be advisable to establish clear non-functional requirements to guide the development and maintenance of the project.",
