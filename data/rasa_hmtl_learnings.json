The repository appears to be a small project focused on Rasa HTML functionality, with minimal documentation about team workflows and standards. No specific team preferences were identified in the areas of code organization, version control workflows, coding style guidelines, code review standards, testing philosophy, PR style guidelines, issue style guidelines, or commit message guidelines.\n\nThe repository structure suggests this may be an individual or small-scale project rather than one with formalized team processes. For a more comprehensive team preferences document, additional documentation would be needed that outlines the team's working agreements, standards, and practices.",
