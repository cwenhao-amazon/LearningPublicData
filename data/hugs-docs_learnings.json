    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the team based on the repository analysis. The repository appears to be focused on HUGS documentation, with specific workflows and processes in place for version control and documentation management.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses Git with sample hook scripts that suggest a structured approach to version control:\n\n- Sample Git hooks are provided in the repository, including:\n  - `pre-commit.sample`: Checks for non-ASCII filenames and whitespace errors\n  - `pre-push.sample`: Prevents pushing commits with messages starting with \"WIP\"\n  - `prepare-commit-msg.sample`: Can modify commit messages before they're finalized\n\nThese hooks indicate the team values clean commits and may have specific requirements for code quality before allowing commits to be pushed.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nDocumentation changes follow a specific workflow:\n\n- The team uses GitHub workflows for documentation pull requests\n- Two key workflows are defined:\n  - `doc-pr-build.yml`: Builds documentation when PRs modify files in the docs directory\n  - `doc-pr-upload.yml`: Uploads built documentation for preview\n- These workflows leverage the Hugging Face doc-builder tool\n- This approach ensures documentation changes can be properly previewed before merging\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nThe team provides sample Git hooks related to commit message formatting:\n\n- `commit-msg.sample`: Checks for duplicate Signed-off-by lines in commit messages\n- `prepare-commit-msg.sample`: Can modify commit messages by:\n  - Removing help text\n  - Adding git diff output\n  - Adding a Signed-off-by line\n\nWhile these are sample hooks that need to be renamed and enabled to be active, they suggest the team values structured and informative commit messages.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications for HUGS\n\n## Overview\n\nHUGS is a machine learning inference system designed with a focus on hardware optimization, scalability across cloud platforms, and security. The system is built to leverage various GPU accelerators and can be deployed in Kubernetes environments across major cloud providers. Key non-functional priorities include hardware-specific performance optimization, horizontal scalability, and security scanning for sensitive information.\n\n## Performance Requirements\n\nHUGS is specifically optimized for machine learning inference across various hardware accelerators. The system supports multiple GPU models from vendors like NVIDIA and AMD, as well as specialized accelerators such as AWS Inferentia2.\n\nThe performance requirements are closely tied to the hardware capabilities, with different ML models requiring specific GPU resources. The documentation provides detailed information about running inference on these optimized containers, suggesting that performance is a critical aspect of the system.\n\nKey hardware support includes:\n- NVIDIA GPUs (A10G, H100, etc.)\n- AMD GPUs\n- AWS Inferentia2 accelerators\n\n## Scalability Expectations\n\nThe system is designed with horizontal scalability as a core requirement, primarily achieved through:\n\n- **Kubernetes-based deployment**: Detailed instructions for deploying HUGS on Kubernetes clusters, including resource configuration\n- **Cloud provider integrations**: Specific deployment guides for AWS, Azure, and GCP\n\nEach cloud provider deployment includes platform-specific scaling features:\n- AWS deployment includes node group creation and auto-scaling configuration\n- GCP deployment mentions enabling autoscaling for node pools\n\nThis indicates that HUGS is architected to scale horizontally across cloud infrastructure to handle varying inference workloads.\n\n## Security Standards\n\nSecurity is addressed through automated secret scanning:\n\n- **TruffleHog integration**: A GitHub workflow that runs on every push to detect potential secrets in commits\n- **Preventative approach**: The system is designed to prevent the exposure of sensitive information like API keys and credentials\n\nThis security standard helps maintain the integrity of the codebase by ensuring sensitive information is not accidentally committed to the repository.\n\n## Memory/CPU Constraints\n\nThe system has specific memory and computational requirements based on the ML models being deployed:\n\n- **GPU memory specifications**: Detailed requirements for different GPU models\n  - NVIDIA A10G: 24GB GDDR6 memory\n  - NVIDIA H100: 80GB HBM3 memory\n  \n- **Computational capabilities**: Documentation of CUDA cores and Tensor cores for supported hardware\n\nThese constraints are particularly important given the significant memory requirements of large language models that the system appears to support.",
