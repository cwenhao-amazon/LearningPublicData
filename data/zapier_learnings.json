    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary for Hugging Face Zapier Integration\n\nThis repository implements a Zapier integration for Hugging Face's machine learning services, allowing users to leverage natural language processing capabilities through Zapier's automation platform.\n\n## Programming Languages\n- **JavaScript**: The primary programming language used throughout the codebase\n- Files include index.js, authentication.js, and various files in the creates/ and test/ directories\n\n## Backend Technologies\n- **Node.js**: The JavaScript runtime environment used for the application\n- **Zapier Platform**: The framework used to build the Zapier integration app\n- This combination allows the app to run on Zapier's infrastructure and connect to Hugging Face services\n\n## API Design Patterns\n- **REST API integration**: The app integrates with Hugging Face's REST APIs\n- Implements various NLP task endpoints including:\n  - Text generation\n  - Translation\n  - Summarization\n  - Question answering\n  - Zero-shot classification\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n- **Zapier Platform**: The application is deployed on Zapier's platform\n- This provides a serverless execution environment for the integration\n\n## Package Management\n- **npm**: Used for managing JavaScript dependencies\n- Evidenced by package.json and package-lock.json files\n\n## Authentication/Security\n- **API Token Authentication**: Implements Bearer token authentication\n- The Hugging Face API token is passed in the Authorization header as \"Bearer [token]\"\n- Authentication is verified against the Hugging Face API endpoint \"https://huggingface.co/api/whoami-v2\"\n- Tokens are stored securely as password field type, treating them as sensitive information\n\n## Serverless Frameworks\n- **Zapier Platform**: Functions as a serverless framework\n- Allows code execution without managing servers\n- Handles the infrastructure aspects of the integration\n\n## Version Control Systems\n- **Git**: Used for version control\n- Evidenced by .git directory and .gitignore file\n\nThis integration connects Zapier's automation platform with Hugging Face's machine learning capabilities, allowing users to incorporate advanced NLP tasks into their automation workflows without needing to understand the underlying ML technologies.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the Hugging Face Zapier Integration team based on repository analysis.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team follows a feature-based organization structure:\n- Implementation files are stored in feature-specific directories (e.g., `creates/text_generation.js`)\n- Test files mirror this structure in a parallel test directory (e.g., `test/creates/text_generation.js`)\n- This approach keeps related functionality and its tests logically grouped but separated\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team maintains clear coding standards for the Hugging Face Zapier Integration:\n\n### Package Management\n- Uses npm as the package manager\n- Specifies exact versions for core dependencies (e.g., `\"zapier-platform-core\": \"14.0.0\"`)\n- Uses caret ranges for flexible dependencies (e.g., `\"@huggingface/inference\": \"^1.7.1\"`)\n- Maintains Node.js compatibility with v16 or higher\n- Keeps package.json organized with standard sections in conventional order\n\n### Project Structure\n- Uses a standard Node.js project layout with index.js as the entry point\n- Follows Zapier integration conventions\n\n### Code Style Example\n```javascript\n// Import dependencies with consistent ordering\nconst zapier = require('zapier-platform-core');\nconst { HfInference } = require('@huggingface/inference');\n\n// Initialize clients with descriptive variable names\nconst hf = new HfInference(process.env.HUGGING_FACE_API_KEY);\n\n// Export modular functions with descriptive names\nconst performTextGeneration = async (z, bundle) => {\n  try {\n    // Use consistent error handling\n    const response = await hf.textGeneration({\n      model: bundle.inputData.model,\n      inputs: bundle.inputData.prompt,\n    });\n    \n    return {\n      result: response.generated_text,\n      model: bundle.inputData.model\n    };\n  } catch (error) {\n    z.console.error('Error in text generation:', error);\n    throw new Error(`Text generation failed: ${error.message}`);\n  }\n};\n\n// Export module with clear structure\nmodule.exports = {\n  performTextGeneration,\n};\n```\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team employs a feature-based testing approach:\n- Each functionality has its own dedicated test file\n- Test directory structure mirrors the implementation directory structure\n- Examples include `test/creates/text_generation.js`, `test/creates/translation.js`, and `test/creates/summarization.js`\n- Uses Mocha as the testing framework with longer timeouts for ML operations (10 seconds)\n- Includes Should.js and Expect for assertions\n- Tests are run recursively with appropriate timeouts\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe repository includes standard Git hook samples, but there's no evidence of customized hooks or specific version control workflows like GitFlow or GitHub Flow being enforced.\n\n## Commit Messages\n\nThe team appears to use standard Git commit message conventions without additional formatting requirements or automated validation. The repository includes the default Git commit-msg hook sample, but it's not activated.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nThis repository appears to have minimal documented non-functional specifications, with security standards being the only area with explicit implementation details.\n\n## Security Standards\n\nThe repository implements API token authentication with secure storage practices for interacting with external services (specifically Hugging Face API):\n\n- **Bearer token authentication**: Uses the standard \"Bearer\" token format in the Authorization header for API requests\n- **Secure credential storage**: API tokens are configured with `type: 'password'` to ensure they're treated as sensitive information and not displayed in plain text\n- **Principle of least privilege**: Documentation recommends using tokens with \"read access\" only, following security best practices\n- **HTTPS communication**: Authentication tests use HTTPS endpoints (https://huggingface.co/api/whoami-v2) for secure communication\n- **User guidance**: Clear documentation is provided to direct users on obtaining appropriate tokens\n\nThese security measures help protect API credentials and ensure secure communication with external services, though they represent only a portion of what would constitute a comprehensive security implementation.\n\n*Note: Other non-functional specifications such as performance requirements, scalability expectations, maintainability goals, etc. are not explicitly documented in the repository.*",
