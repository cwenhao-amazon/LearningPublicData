Code must be formatted with black and pass flake8 linting and mypy type checking\n6. New features require tests that sufficiently cover the functionality\n7. Bug fixes must include tests that would fail without the fix\n8. Public API additions require proper docstrings following the project's format\n9. Documentation must build without errors\n10. Changes must be documented in the CHANGELOG\n11. The PR template includes checklists for both before and after submission\n12. The review process emphasizes readability and maintainability\n\nThis comprehensive approach ensures code quality while making reviews efficient for maintainers.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nAllenNLP employs comprehensive unit testing with pytest. The testing infrastructure includes:\n\n- `pytest.ini` - Configuration for pytest\n- `tests/` - Test directory mirroring the main package structure\n- `.coveragerc` - Configuration for coverage reporting\n- `codecov.yml` - Configuration for Codecov integration\n- `allennlp/common/testing/test_case.py` - Custom test case base class\n- `allennlp/common/testing/model_test_case.py` - Model-specific test utilities\n\nThe presence of custom test case classes suggests standardized testing approaches, and the coverage configuration files indicate a focus on maintaining high test coverage.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nAllenNLP has specific requirements for pull requests:\n\n1. PRs must reference issue numbers with \"Fixes #\" or \"Closes #\" syntax\n2. Changes must be clearly listed in the PR description\n3. Contributors must complete a \"Before submitting\" checklist:\n   - Following the steps in the CONTRIBUTING.md guide\n   - Adding/updating docstrings following the project's syntax\n   - Including tests that fail without bug fixes\n   - Adding sufficient test coverage for new features\n4. After submission, contributors must ensure:\n   - All GitHub Actions jobs pass\n   - Test coverage is high (at least 90%)\n5. PRs should be created on separate branches, not directly on main\n6. Code must be formatted with black, pass flake8 linting and mypy type checking\n7. Documentation must build without errors\n8. Changes must be documented in the CHANGELOG\n\nThis structured approach ensures consistency and quality in contributions.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe team uses structured issue templates for different types of issues:\n\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md` - Template for reporting bugs\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md` - Template for requesting features\n- `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/question.md` - Template for asking questions\n\nThese templates guide contributors in providing the necessary information for each type of issue, making it easier for maintainers to understand and address them.",
