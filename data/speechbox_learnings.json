    "summary": "# Tech Stack Summary for SpeechBox\n\nThis repository is a Python-based speech processing library that leverages modern machine learning techniques for tasks like speaker diarization (identifying who spoke when) and transcript restoration (adding punctuation). The project is built around HuggingFace's Transformers ecosystem and PyTorch for deep learning capabilities.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\nPython serves as the primary programming language for this project. The repository follows standard Python package structure with:\n- `setup.py` and `pyproject.toml` for package configuration\n- Source code organized in the `src/speechbox/` directory\n- Typical Python module structure with `__init__.py` files\n\n## Backend Technologies\n\nThe backend is built with Python and integrates several specialized libraries:\n\n- **HuggingFace Transformers**: Core library for accessing pre-trained speech and language models\n- **PyTorch**: Underlying deep learning framework\n- **Audio Processing Libraries**:\n  - `pyannote.audio`: Used for speaker diarization\n  - `torchaudio`: PyTorch's audio processing library\n\nThe codebase implements conditional imports to handle dependencies gracefully, with utility functions like:\n- `is_transformers_available()`\n- `is_torchaudio_available()`\n\nKey components include:\n- `ASRDiarizationPipeline`: For transcription with speaker identification\n- `PunctuationRestorer`: For adding punctuation to transcripts\n\n## Testing Frameworks\n\nThe project employs a comprehensive testing and quality control setup:\n\n- **Pytest**: Main testing framework\n- **Code Quality Tools**:\n  - `flake8`: For linting and style checking\n  - `black`: For code formatting\n  - `isort`: For import sorting\n\nThese tools are configured in the Makefile with commands like `make quality` to check the 'examples' and 'src' directories. A custom utility script (`check_dummies.py`) ensures consistency between main module imports and dummy implementations.\n\n## Build Systems\n\n**setuptools** is used as the build system for this Python package, as evidenced by:\n- `setup.py` for package configuration\n- `pyproject.toml` for build system specification\n\n## Package Management\n\n**pip** serves as the package manager, which is standard for Python projects. This is supported by:\n- `setup.py` for dependency specification\n- `pyproject.toml` for modern Python packaging\n- `dependency_versions_table.py` for version management\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThe project relies on several machine learning frameworks:\n\n- **transformers**: HuggingFace's library for accessing pre-trained models\n- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework\n- **torchaudio**: Audio processing extension for PyTorch\n- **pyannote.audio**: Specialized library for speaker diarization\n- **scipy**: Scientific computing library\n\nThe project includes dummy implementation files for testing and fallback functionality:\n- `dummy_transformers_objects.py`\n- `dummy_transformers_and_accelerate_and_scipy_objects.py`\n- `dummy_transformers_and_torchaudio_and_pyannote_objects.py`\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as indicated by:\n- `.git/` directory\n- `.gitignore` file for specifying ignored files",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences for SpeechBox Repository\n\nThis document summarizes the working style and organizational approach of the SpeechBox team based on repository analysis. The team follows a structured, Python-standard approach with clear guidelines for contributions, code organization, and quality assurance.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nSpeechBox follows a standard Python package structure:\n- `src/speechbox/` - Main package code\n- `examples/` - Example implementations\n- `utils/` - Utility functions and tools\n\nThis organization provides clear separation of concerns and makes the codebase navigable for new contributors.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team emphasizes simplicity and clarity over complex abstractions:\n\n### Core Principles\n- **Single-file task implementation**: Each task should be contained in a single file\n- **Minimal inter-file dependencies**: Code duplication is preferred over complex abstractions\n- **Clear ownership**: Each task has a designated maintainer\n- **Soft dependencies**: No new required dependencies, using optional imports instead\n\n### Specific Guidelines\n- Use snake_case for variables, functions, and file names\n- All public methods must have informative docstrings compatible with Sphinx\n- Include code examples in docstrings where appropriate\n- Maintain a task table in the README with links to implementations and maintainers\n\nThe team values maintainability and readability over code reuse, as evidenced by their preference for duplicating code rather than creating complex abstractions between files.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team uses a GitHub-based fork and PR workflow with feature branches:\n\n- Contributors fork the repository and create feature branches\n- Direct work on the main branch is discouraged\n- Descriptive branch names are required\n- Regular synchronization with upstream using fetch and rebase\n- Issue labels like \"New Task\" help organize feature requests\n\nThis approach helps maintain a clean commit history and provides clear tracking of changes.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nPRs must meet specific requirements before merging:\n\n- Descriptive PR titles summarizing contributions\n- Links to related issues in PR descriptions\n- Work-in-progress marked with [WIP]\n- All existing tests must pass\n- New code requires high-coverage tests\n- Public methods need informative docstrings compatible with Sphinx\n- Large non-text files should be avoided\n\nThe team enforces a \"no quality testing = no merge\" policy, emphasizing the importance of code quality.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team prioritizes comprehensive testing:\n\n- High test coverage is required for all new code\n- Automated quality checks using tools like flake8, black, and isort\n- Support for both regular and slow tests (marked with @slow)\n- Utility tools ensure consistency between main module imports and dummy implementations\n\nThe Makefile provides standardized commands for running quality checks, indicating a systematic approach to quality control.\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nPull requests follow a structured format:\n\n- Descriptive titles that summarize the contribution\n- Issue linking in PR descriptions\n- WIP marking for incomplete work\n- Comprehensive checklist for quality assurance\n- Feature branches with descriptive names\n\nThis structured approach helps maintain clarity and organization in the development process.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nIssues follow a structured format based on type:\n\n### Bug Reports\n- Verification that the bug hasn't been reported already\n\n### Feature Requests\n- Motivation explaining the problem or need\n- Full paragraph describing the feature\n- Code snippet demonstrating future use\n- Links to related papers if applicable\n- Supporting materials like drawings or screenshots\n\nFeature requests for new tasks should be prefixed with \"[New task]\" in the title. The team believes well-written issues are \"80% of the way there\" toward implementation.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nNo specific commit message format requirements were identified in the repository. While the team has detailed guidelines for PRs and issues, they appear to allow flexibility in commit message formatting.",
