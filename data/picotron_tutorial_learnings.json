The code is structured in numbered step directories, each implementing a specific aspect of distributed training:\n\n1. Step 1: Modeling\n2. Step 2: Process group manager\n3. Step 3: Dataloader\n4. Step 4: Tensor parallel\n5. Step 5: Data parallel (naive implementation)\n6. Step 6: Data parallel (bucket implementation)\n7. Step 7: Pipeline parallel (AFAB - All Forward All Backward)\n8. Step 8: Pipeline parallel (1F1B - One Forward One Backward)\n\nThis organization demonstrates a methodical, incremental approach where each step builds upon previous ones, showing a progressive implementation approach to parallel processing techniques.\n\n## Architectural Patterns\n\nThe repository implements a distributed training architecture with multiple parallelism strategies:\n\n- **Tensor Parallelism**: Splitting model tensors across devices\n- **Data Parallelism**: \n  - Naive implementation\n  - Bucket implementation (likely for communication optimization)\n- **Pipeline Parallelism**:\n  - AFAB (All Forward All Backward) scheduling algorithm\n  - 1F1B (One Forward One Backward) scheduling algorithm\n\nThese patterns reflect advanced distributed computing approaches for training large models efficiently across multiple computing resources.\n\n## Knowledge Sharing\n\nThis appears to be an educational repository with step-by-step implementation examples. Each step directory contains a README.md file, suggesting that the repository is designed for educational purposes, with documentation explaining each implementation step.\n\nThe progressive nature of the steps, combined with dedicated documentation for each component, indicates a strong focus on knowledge transfer and educational value, likely intended to help others understand complex distributed training concepts through practical examples.",
