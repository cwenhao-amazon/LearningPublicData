While many team preferences are not explicitly documented, the code structure itself reveals important patterns in how the team works.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a modular organization strategy with separate files for different components:\n\n- Core modeling components: `modeling.py`, `layers.py`\n- Data processing: `data.py`, `bert_data.py`\n- Specialized architectural components: `efficient_attention.py`, `multihead.py`\n- Training and execution: `training.py`, `run_classifier.py`, `run_pretraining.py`\n\nThis separation indicates a preference for clean boundaries between different functional areas of the codebase, making it easier to maintain and extend.\n\n## Documentation Style\n\nDocumentation is primarily implemented through:\n\n- Docstrings in Python files\n\nThe team uses standard Python docstrings to document the purpose and functionality of classes and functions, as evidenced in files like `modeling.py`, `layers.py`, `efficient_attention.py`, `multihead.py`, and `training.py`. This approach keeps documentation close to the code it describes, making it more likely to stay up-to-date and useful for developers.\n\n## Architectural Patterns\n\nThe repository demonstrates a clear preference for:\n\n- Modular architecture with separation of concerns\n\nThe codebase is structured to separate different concerns into distinct modules:\n- Data processing logic\n- Model definition\n- Training procedures\n- Execution scripts\n\nThis architectural approach promotes code reusability, easier testing, and clearer responsibility boundaries between different parts of the system.",
