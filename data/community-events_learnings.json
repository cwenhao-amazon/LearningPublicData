    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the identified team preferences and working style based on the repository analysis. The team appears to be focused on machine learning projects across multiple frameworks, with a clear organizational structure to support this diverse technical ecosystem.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe team employs a **framework-specific organization** approach with separate directories for different machine learning frameworks and projects. This organizational structure includes:\n\n- Dedicated directories for specific ML frameworks:\n  - `huggan/pytorch/`\n  - `huggan/tensorflow/`\n  - `jax-controlnet-sprint/`\n  - `keras-dreambooth-sprint/`\n  - `keras-sprint/`\n  - `sklearn-sprint/`\n\n- Project-specific directories:\n  - `whisper-fine-tuning-event/`\n  - `computer-vision-study-group/`\n\nThis organization reflects a team that works across multiple machine learning frameworks and organizes their work by both framework and specific project initiatives or sprints. The structure suggests a modular approach that allows team members to easily locate and work with specific technologies or project components.\n\nThe framework-centric organization likely facilitates:\n- Clear separation of concerns between different ML technologies\n- Easier onboarding for framework specialists\n- Simplified management of framework-specific dependencies\n- Focused sprint or event-based collaborative work",
