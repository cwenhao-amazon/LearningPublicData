    "summary": "# Tech Choices Summary\n\nThis repository appears to be a data processing and machine learning project focused on video analysis, categorization, and annotation. The tech stack is built around Python with specialized tools for machine learning and infrastructure.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n**Python** is the primary programming language used throughout the project. Python files are distributed across multiple directories handling different aspects of the workflow:\n\n- Raw dataset processing (`filter-yt-commons.py`, `download_and_upload.py`)\n- Video categorization (`tgi_inference_client.py`, `create_prompts.py`)\n- Content annotation (`video2annotation.py`)\n- Dynamic filtering (`worddensityfiltering.py`, `check_static.py`)\n- Fine alignment (`video_alignment.py`)\n- Content selection (`oracle.py`)\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\nThe project leverages several infrastructure components:\n\n- **Docker** - Used for containerization, as evidenced by Dockerfile presence in multiple directories including `rawdataset/ytdlps3/` and `dynamicfilters/videodynamismfiltering/`\n- **AWS S3** - Integrated for cloud storage of data, particularly for the YouTube dataset components\n- **Slurm** - Employed for cluster computing and job scheduling, particularly for machine learning inference tasks\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\n**TGI (Text Generation Inference)** is used as the primary machine learning framework, with:\n\n- Dedicated inference client (`tgi_inference_client.py`)\n- Slurm job launcher for TGI (`launchTGI-Slurm.sh`)\n- Prompt engineering files for text generation (`gemini_prompt.txt`)\n\nThis suggests the project leverages large language models for text generation and inference tasks related to video content analysis.\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n**Git** is used for version control, as indicated by the standard Git directory structure and configuration files.",

    "summary": "# FineVideo Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working style and organizational approach of the FineVideo team based on repository analysis. The team appears to follow a structured, modular approach to video processing with clear coding standards and version control practices.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe repository follows a modular organization by functionality, with distinct directories representing different stages or components of a video processing pipeline:\n\n- `rawdataset/` - Handling raw dataset operations\n- `videocategorization/` - Categorizing video content\n- `contentannotation/` - Annotating video content\n- `dynamicfilters/` - Filtering video content\n- `finealignment/` - Aligning video content\n- `contentselection/` - Selecting content from videos\n\nThis organization reflects a pipeline-based approach to video processing, with each module handling a specific stage in the workflow.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team has set up Git hooks for workflow enforcement, though they are currently in sample form and not actively enforced. These hooks include:\n\n1. `pre-push.sample` - Prevents pushing commits with messages starting with \"WIP\" (work in progress)\n2. `pre-commit.sample` - Verifies what's about to be committed, including checks for non-ASCII filenames and whitespace errors\n3. `prepare-commit-msg.sample` - Provides examples for modifying commit messages\n4. `commit-msg.sample` - Checks commit log messages for consistency\n\nWhen activated (by removing the .sample extension), these hooks would enforce specific workflow practices to maintain code quality and consistency.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team follows comprehensive coding style guidelines that promote readability, maintainability, and consistency:\n\n### Naming Conventions\n- **Variables**: Snake_case (e.g., `video_file`, `input_directory`)\n- **Functions**: Snake_case (e.g., `download_video_from_s3`, `process_video`)\n- **Constants**: Uppercase with underscores (e.g., `GEMINI_PATH`, `OPENAI_PATH`)\n- **Classes**: PascalCase (e.g., `VideoProcessor`, `Schema`, `Character`)\n- **Type definitions**: PascalCase for TypedDict classes (e.g., `Character`, `Timestamps`)\n\n### File Structure and Organization\n- Files begin with a comment block explaining purpose\n- CONFIG section at the top with configurable parameters\n- Related functions grouped together\n- Complex scripts use a main function or class-based approach\n- Executable scripts follow the `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` pattern\n\n### Indentation and Whitespace\n- 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)\n- Blank lines between logical sections\n- Spaces around operators and after commas\n- Reasonable line length (< 120 characters)\n\n### Comments and Documentation\n- Descriptive file header comments\n- Function docstrings with parameters and return values\n- Inline comments for complex logic\n- Triple quotes for multi-line docstrings\n\n### Function Design\n- Single responsibility per function\n- Descriptive docstrings with type information\n- Type hints for parameters and return values\n- Reasonable function size (< 50 lines)\n\n### Error Handling\n- Try/except blocks for error-prone operations\n- Specific exception types when possible\n- Informative error messages\n- Dictionary-based error information for complex operations\n\n### Data Processing Patterns\n- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis\n- Chained pandas operations for readability\n- List comprehensions for simple transformations\n- Functional approaches for data transformations\n\n### Command Line Interface\n- Argparse for command-line argument parsing\n- Clear usage instructions in help text\n- Support for required and optional arguments\n\n### AWS Integration\n- Boto3 for AWS service interactions\n- Module or class-level client initialization\n- Appropriate AWS-specific exception handling\n- Environment variables for AWS configuration when possible\n\nThe team's coding style emphasizes clarity, consistency, and maintainability, with particular attention to documentation, error handling, and type safety.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided data, there are no explicitly defined non-functional specifications in the repository. The analysis did not identify any documented requirements for:\n\n- Performance requirements\n- Scalability expectations\n- Security standards\n- Maintainability goals\n- Memory/CPU constraints\n- Load testing parameters\n- Caching strategies\n- Logging requirements\n- Audit trail requirements\n- Network requirements\n\nThis suggests that the project may:\n- Be in early development stages where non-functional requirements haven't been formalized\n- Have implicit rather than explicit non-functional requirements\n- Focus primarily on functional requirements with non-functional aspects addressed on an as-needed basis\n- Need further documentation of its non-functional specifications\n\nFor a more comprehensive understanding of the project's non-functional characteristics, additional investigation would be required, potentially through interviews with stakeholders or examination of related documentation outside the repository.",
