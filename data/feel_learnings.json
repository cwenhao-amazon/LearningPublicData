    "summary": "# Tech Stack Overview\n\nThis repository appears to be a Python-based machine learning project with a focus on model training and evaluation. The project uses modern Python tooling and GitHub for version control and automation.\n\n## Programming Languages\n\n- **Python**: The primary programming language used throughout the project\n- Files include `pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `data/generate_dpo.py`, `app/app.py`, and `ml/trainer.py`\n- Python is used for both the application logic and machine learning components\n\n## Package Management\n\n- **pip**: Traditional Python package manager, evidenced by `requirements.txt`\n- **uv**: A newer, faster Python package manager and installer, indicated by the presence of `uv.lock`\n- The project uses modern Python packaging with `pyproject.toml` for configuration\n\n## Infrastructure & Deployment\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Used for CI/CD and automation tasks\n- Configured through workflow files in the `.github/workflows/` directory, including:\n  - `proof-html.yml`\n  - `auto-assign.yml`\n\n## CI/CD Tools\n\n- **GitHub Actions**: Handles continuous integration and deployment processes\n- Workflow files suggest automated testing or deployment processes\n\n## Version Control Systems\n\n- **Git**: Used for version control\n- Evidenced by `.git/config`, `.gitignore`, and Git hook samples like `.git/hooks/pre-commit.sample`\n\nThe repository appears to be a machine learning project with evaluation pipelines (`ml/eval/evaluation_pipeline.py`, `ml/eval/reward_eval.py`), though the specific machine learning frameworks aren't explicitly identified in the file structure. The project also includes an application component (`app/app.py`, `app/feedback.py`), but the specific backend framework isn't clearly indicated.",

    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the repository. While the available information is limited, several patterns and practices can be observed.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository follows Python best practices with minimal explicit style guidelines. Based on the available information:\n\n1. **Project Structure**\n   - Uses standard Python packaging with pyproject.toml\n   - Organizes dependencies into logical groups\n\n2. **Dependency Management**\n   - Specifies minimum version requirements with >= syntax\n   - Groups related dependencies into named categories (ml, app)\n   - Maintains clear separation between core and optional dependencies\n\n3. **Versioning**\n   - Uses semantic versioning (0.1.0 format)\n\n4. **Python Version**\n   - Requires Python 3.11 or newer, suggesting use of modern Python features\n\nThe project appears to follow modern Python standards, though specific conventions for naming, indentation, comments, and other style elements aren't explicitly documented in the available files.\n\n## Code Review Standards\n\nThe repository implements an automated workflow for issue and pull request management:\n\n- Automatic assignment of issues and pull requests to a specific user (riddhibhagwat) when opened\n- This suggests a centralized review process where one person is responsible for initial triage\n- No specific review criteria, checklists, or approval thresholds are defined in the available files\n\n## PR Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository has minimal documented PR guidelines:\n\n- Automatic assignment system for new pull requests to user \"riddhibhagwat\"\n- No specific guidelines regarding PR size, commit structure, description format, or labeling conventions are defined in the provided files\n\n## Repository Organization\n\nWhile not explicitly documented, the repository structure suggests a domain-based organization:\n\n- `app/` - Application code\n- `ml/` - Machine learning code\n- `data/` - Data-related code\n- `ml/eval/` - Evaluation code for machine learning models\n\nThis organization indicates a separation of concerns between application logic, machine learning components, and evaluation tools.\n\nThe repository appears to be focused on a machine learning application with evaluation capabilities, though the specific domain and purpose aren't clear from the available information.",

    "summary": "# Non-functional Specifications Summary\n\nBased on the provided data, there is insufficient explicit information about non-functional specifications in the repository. The repository appears to contain machine learning code (ml/trainer.py, ml/dpo_pipeline.py) that might be related to performance requirements and memory/CPU constraints, but no specific requirements or constraints are documented.\n\nThe absence of clearly defined non-functional specifications suggests that:\n\n1. The project may be in early development stages where non-functional requirements haven't been formalized\n2. Non-functional specifications might exist in documentation not included in the analyzed files\n3. The project may be focusing primarily on functional requirements at this stage\n\nFor a more comprehensive understanding of the non-functional specifications, additional documentation such as project requirements, design documents, or configuration files would be needed.",
