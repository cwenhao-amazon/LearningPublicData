    "summary": "# Team Preferences Summary\n\nThis summary outlines the key working preferences and organizational approaches identified in the TensorRT LLM repository. The team demonstrates a structured and disciplined approach to software development with clear organization patterns and tooling to maintain code quality.\n\n## Code Organization\n\nThe codebase follows a modular organization strategy with clear separation between language implementations:\n\n- **Separate directories** for Python (`tensorrt_llm/`) and C++ (`cpp/tensorrt_llm/`) code\n- **Python code** follows a package structure with submodules for different components\n- **C++ code** is organized in a hierarchical structure with include and implementation files\n- Component-specific directories (kernels, runtime, plugins, etc.) maintain consistent organization across both language implementations\n\nThis organization reflects a thoughtful approach to managing a complex codebase that spans multiple programming languages while maintaining clear boundaries between components.\n\n## Version Control Workflows\n\nThe team employs GitHub Flow with:\n\n- Pull request-based development\n- Integrated issue tracking\n- CI workflows (`.github/workflows/blossom-ci.yml`)\n- Structured issue templates\n\nThis standard GitHub-based workflow supports collaborative development while maintaining quality control through the PR review process.\n\n## Coding Style Guidelines\n\nThe team maintains strict coding style consistency through automated tooling:\n\n- **C++ code**:\n  - Uses Google style with 4-space indentation\n  - camelCase for methods and variables\n  - PascalCase for classes\n  - Header files use include guards with uppercase project-specific prefixes\n  - Enforced via clang-format (`.clang-format`)\n\n- **Python code**:\n  - Follows PEP 8 style guidelines\n  - Configuration in `setup.cfg`\n\n- **Style enforcement**:\n  - Pre-commit hooks (`.pre-commit-config.yaml`) ensure style compliance before code is committed\n\nThis comprehensive approach to style guidelines demonstrates the team's commitment to code readability and maintainability.\n\n## Testing Philosophy\n\nThe team employs comprehensive unit testing across the codebase:\n\n- **Separate test directories** for Python (`tests/`) and C++ (`cpp/tests/`) code\n- **Component-based organization** of tests that mirrors the main codebase structure\n- Extensive test coverage suggesting test-driven or test-oriented development practices\n\nThis testing approach indicates a strong commitment to code quality and regression prevention.\n\n## Issue Style Guidelines\n\nThe repository includes a structured bug report template (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.yml`) that standardizes how issues are reported. This structured approach helps ensure that bug reports contain all necessary information for efficient troubleshooting.\n\n## Commit Message Style Guidelines\n\nWhile not explicitly documented, the project appears to follow conventional commit message practices:\n\n- Subject line with clear description of changes\n- Optional detailed body explaining rationale\n- Likely enforced or checked via pre-commit hooks\n\nThe presence of pre-commit configuration suggests some level of standardization in how commits are formatted and described.",
